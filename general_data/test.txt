EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health
EVENT : When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was
EVENT : No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country
EVENT : This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside
EVENT : They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it

EVENT : The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity
EVENT : A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
EVENT : The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store
EVENT : It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
EVENT : Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
EVENT : A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
EVENT : Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
EVENT : They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
EVENT : I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology
EVENT : The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas
EVENT : One is the death of Yasser Arafat
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism
EVENT : The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad

EVENT : In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project
EVENT : She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project
EVENT : It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read
EVENT : Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it
EVENT : Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it
EVENT : Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner
EVENT : Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
EVENT : In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
EVENT : It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
EVENT : A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
EVENT : She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
EVENT : The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
EVENT : It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
EVENT : The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
EVENT : Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
EVENT : But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
EVENT : She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office
EVENT : The American rift with Syria deepened this week, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday

EVENT : In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups
EVENT : Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis
EVENT : Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis

EVENT : A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe
EVENT : They don't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly
EVENT : The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon
EVENT : Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party
EVENT : Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities
EVENT : Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area
EVENT : Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed
EVENT : His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived
EVENT : PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader
EVENT : It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different

EVENT : Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my Krystals
EVENT : It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the Plains...Auburn, Alabama
EVENT : Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it
EVENT : One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat
EVENT : Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90's
EVENT : It seems that in recent years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole
EVENT : Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad
EVENT : You never EVER show up at court, especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fucking FUR COAT
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole
EVENT : Remember when Michael Milken got busted, he was not forced to give up his secret accounts, and when the fine of 600 million was levied...HE PAID IT

EVENT : This isn't a football game, and it's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion
EVENT : I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are
EVENT : A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook
EVENT : This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship

EVENT : After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out
EVENT : Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline
EVENT : This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts
EVENT : This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body
EVENT : Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated
EVENT : One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field
EVENT : This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time
EVENT : There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury
EVENT : If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman
EVENT : I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total, complete with my rental car for a week
EVENT : I'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault
EVENT : I will return this piece of shit on Friday, only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife's car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired
EVENT : A year ago, Tuberville was one reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired BEFORE the Alabama game
EVENT : Then, the AD and President get canned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things
EVENT : He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny
EVENT : He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny
EVENT : He could have sex with an endangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him
EVENT : Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts
EVENT : Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts
EVENT : It seems that AD and frequent "No we didn't" Ohio State front man Andy Geiger is "retiring" after 11 years at the helm
EVENT : Of course, it was discovered that his men's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit, but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates...right Andy
EVENT : Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc
EVENT : It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits including cash, cars, grade fixing, etc
EVENT : The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game
EVENT : That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year

EVENT : Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison
EVENT : Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks (Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but it's a gamble and not a business strategy
EVENT : The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that
EVENT : And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice
EVENT : This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some money
EVENT : You have company coming over for dinner
EVENT : You're hosting a wedding reception
EVENT : That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route
EVENT : So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot
EVENT : Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals
EVENT : I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other
EVENT : And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back

EVENT : How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest
EVENT : Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country
EVENT : It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo
EVENT : Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver
EVENT : Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction
EVENT : everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber
EVENT : Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued, and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do 2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we Merckers might be safe
EVENT : It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies
EVENT : The Capital Spectator reports on the latest: Not only China, but India's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade
EVENT : Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early

EVENT : But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
EVENT : For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
EVENT : Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
EVENT : As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
NEVENT : Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad
NEVENT : On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands
NEVENT : Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show
NEVENT : It's something you can always expect from these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a show when they're in town
NEVENT : Naturally, I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time
NEVENT : I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests
NEVENT : On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year
NEVENT : In addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat
NEVENT : Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday
NEVENT : On Sunday we saw Saw and as expected I was less than satisfied
NEVENT : It was neither better nor worse than last week's The Grudge but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies
NEVENT : If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's worth it
NEVENT : I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added)
NEVENT : The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada
NEVENT : He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets
NEVENT : I believe that factors of political correctness are at work, he said
NEVENT : Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime
NEVENT : Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June
NEVENT : Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester
NEVENT : It doesn't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain
NEVENT : Just as long as it's there, they feel safe
NEVENT : I can see why he would do it
NEVENT : He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja
NEVENT : There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances, said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson
NEVENT : Two shots to the head, said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
NEVENT : You can't trust these people
NEVENT : He should not be investigated
NEVENT : He did nothing wrong
NEVENT : I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity
NEVENT : I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it
NEVENT : This is problem that needs to be addressed
NEVENT : As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain assault weapons signed by President Clinton
NEVENT : The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog
NEVENT : Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an assault weapon
NEVENT : So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger
NEVENT : Well, we'll debate that later on in the show
NEVENT : We'll have a couple of experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then
NEVENT : Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way
NEVENT : Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician
NEVENT : Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency
NEVENT : And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University
NEVENT : Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting
NEVENT : And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country
NEVENT : Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks
NEVENT : So it's OK it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
NEVENT : Department and the Pentagon
NEVENT : Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : ust a minute, let me finish my sentence, please
NEVENT : No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was
NEVENT : Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no
NEVENT : Why not
NEVENT : Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich
NEVENT : I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years
NEVENT : God, I hope so
NEVENT : that's all I can say
NEVENT : I love Senator Dodd
NEVENT : He would have brought a lot to the race
NEVENT : He brings a lot to the Senate and to the debate
NEVENT : And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights
NEVENT : Well, the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February
NEVENT : Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion
NEVENT : Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse
NEVENT : One of his aides tells the current issue of TIME, magazine, quote, even if it's $500 billion, so what
NEVENT : Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund
NEVENT : You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know
NEVENT : Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them
NEVENT : Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment
NEVENT : They don't go together
NEVENT : And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia
NEVENT : There just isn't one
NEVENT : Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts
NEVENT : There never has been one
NEVENT : There has been one for 60 years
NEVENT : Welcome back
NEVENT : Bad move
NEVENT : But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true
NEVENT : But what we just learned this week from Newsweek magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995
NEVENT : Why hasn't our president told us that
NEVENT : Why do we have to learn it from Newsweek
NEVENT : I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed
NEVENT : Good point
NEVENT : But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him
NEVENT : Why do we learn from Newsweek
NEVENT : Should he level with us
NEVENT : Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men
NEVENT : I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids
NEVENT : I am shook over the aftermath
NEVENT : But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler
NEVENT : Take a look at it
NEVENT : That's pretty good support isn't it
NEVENT : Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this
NEVENT : I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book
NEVENT : You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head
NEVENT : But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy
NEVENT : Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down
NEVENT : Well, I've seen some of the figures
NEVENT : Once you start telling Americans the story, the administration refuse today tell us story
NEVENT : Tom, you know what liberals want
NEVENT : They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city
NEVENT : The Clinton people all say
NEVENT : Former Congressman, Bob Dornan from California
NEVENT : You're not going to get a smoking city
NEVENT : Time for Fireback, when the viewers fire back at us
NEVENT : Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach, California that would be nice in this weathers Paul, I guess we're going after all
NEVENT : Case in point, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once
NEVENT : Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better
NEVENT : In fact, I've already said it
NEVENT : Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us
NEVENT : We need allies
NEVENT : And Bush is so far angered every ally we have
NEVENT : Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this guy get preferential treatment
NEVENT : And I thought he was I thought he was busy running the Redskins
NEVENT : No
NEVENT : OK
NEVENT : The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City
NEVENT : Mr.Novak, I don't understand the problem
NEVENT : I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville and Begala, who don't want tax cuts
NEVENT : Pay it anyway
NEVENT : They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich
NEVENT : That's a better strategy
NEVENT : David Horn of Long Island, New York, writes, How can Bush say he's for democracy
NEVENT : Where did he learn to govern, 1930's Chicago
NEVENT : Hi
NEVENT : I'm Paul Avalar from Tempe, Arizona
NEVENT : I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : That's a great question
NEVENT : It's an unanswerable point
NEVENT : He hasn't been able to answer it
NEVENT : And Tom Andrews wasn't able to answer it
NEVENT : Look, we need allies to catch these guys
NEVENT : We got him because the Pakistanis got him
NEVENT : We didn't get him
NEVENT : It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they're cooperating now
NEVENT : You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news
NEVENT : It is just something you cannot handle
NEVENT : No
NEVENT : From the left, I'm Paul Begala
NEVENT : Good night for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Robert Novak
NEVENT : Join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month
NEVENT : Is her family's pain and suffering only worth $250,000
NEVENT : Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford the medical malpractice rates
NEVENT : We'll just run a scroll of some of the states
NEVENT : They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas
NEVENT : This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America, isn't it
NEVENT : Another one of your leading questions
NEVENT : This is a medical malpractice crisis
NEVENT : And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down
NEVENT : And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons
NEVENT : But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctrs in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each
NEVENT : That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist
NEVENT : You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics
NEVENT : This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity
NEVENT : The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level
NEVENT : I haven't yet met one senator or representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent, unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases
NEVENT : And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no one is saying cap those
NEVENT : Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here
NEVENT : Thank you
NEVENT : Pleasure to be here
NEVENT : And, I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today
NEVENT : He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood
NEVENT : Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages
NEVENT : Listen to what Mr. McCormick said and I'll ask you to respond
NEVENT : Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are not frivolous
NEVENT : Isn't he right
NEVENT : Isn't our president wrong to be did he win the Lottery
NEVENT : You know, Mr. Bush President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery
NEVENT : Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care
NEVENT : The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system
NEVENT : The current system doesn't measure negligence
NEVENT : It measures disability
NEVENT : Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community
NEVENT : Those are important points, I don't doubt
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : Well, what has to be done here is balance
NEVENT : What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
NEVENT : And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked
NEVENT : Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels
NEVENT : And in Florida, they've been very weak on it
NEVENT : In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever
NEVENT : They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing
NEVENT : I want to respond to that
NEVENT : The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today
NEVENT : First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used
NEVENT : It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine
NEVENT : It doesn't list that
NEVENT : Now are these bad doctors
NEVENT : We'll have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians
NEVENT : We've got to take a break
NEVENT : Maybe they are bad doctors
NEVENT : Welcome back
NEVENT : Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
NEVENT : President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays
NEVENT : We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano
NEVENT : Dr Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break
NEVENT : He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors
NEVENT : It turns out that he didn't do any ind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas
NEVENT : It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized
NEVENT : Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade
NEVENT : That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now
NEVENT : Well, first off
NEVENT : Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me
NEVENT : Sure
NEVENT : What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding
NEVENT : The AMA supports that
NEVENT : But it's also
NEVENT : Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case
NEVENT : Troy Brennan of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability
NEVENT : So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize
NEVENT : Even file a claim
NEVENT : And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
NEVENT : On dog food
NEVENT : It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
NEVENT : That's a fraction of physician income
NEVENT : It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion
NEVENT : What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here
NEVENT : That's what the people in Congress have to do
NEVENT : They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care
NEVENT : Doctors are going
NEVENT : They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of a few specialties
NEVENT : Because of the premiums
NEVENT : But first of all let me
NEVENT : Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies
NEVENT : No. Let's talk about the facts
NEVENT : Let's talk about the facts
NEVENT : That's the fact
NEVENT : I was just in Oklahoma, they own this insurance company
NEVENT : They are trying to do their very best
NEVENT : It's a company not for profit
NEVENT : What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in
NEVENT : And as far as the investment income, A.M
NEVENT : Bests show that in the past five years, the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent
NEVENT : Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis
NEVENT : Why do you want that to be secret
NEVENT : All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you, the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list
NEVENT : Let's listen to what he said to the AMA today
NEVENT : They should be able to recover non- economic damages as well
NEVENT : But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages should be capped at $250,000
NEVENT : What in the world is wrong with that
NEVENT : Tell me what's wrong with that
NEVENT : What's wrong
NEVENT : Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy
NEVENT : Wait a minute
NEVENT : The head of AIG a few years ago was making $250,000 every week
NEVENT : Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though
NEVENT : Not for you, but for most people it's a lot of money
NEVENT : These executives, why don't you tell
NEVENT : In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California
NEVENT : Why don't you cap insurance
NEVENT : Mr. Palmisano, go ahead
NEVENT : Give me a moment, please
NEVENT : Go ahead, go ahead
NEVENT : In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the ones you can't quantify
NEVENT : So all medicals, all rehabilitation, care services in the home, lost wages
NEVENT : No, no, no
NEVENT : I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time
NEVENT : Doug Friedman, who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years ago, says he wants you to run for president again
NEVENT : I know you're saying it's much too early to run for president
NEVENT : But one simple question, Ralph, will you consider another run for president
NEVENT : Much too early to consider
NEVENT : I am concerned about Donald Zook, who's head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West, saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system
NEVENT : He said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self-inflicted
NEVENT : Here's an insurance company executive who is saying that
NEVENT : Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting
NEVENT : What we need to do is look at all of the people who don't have doctors
NEVENT : Hey, let's get some agreement
NEVENT : Should we get some agreement
NEVENT : What
NEVENT : Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors
NEVENT : We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits
NEVENT : Fine. Fine
NEVENT : What kind of peer review is that
NEVENT : Wait. Wait
NEVENT : Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors
NEVENT : You're in AMA
NEVENT : We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors
NEVENT : Do you want to control insurance rates
NEVENT : We want the free market to dictate what is done
NEVENT : The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials here on CNN or we're all out of
NEVENT : Thanks. Privilege to be here
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Over in Iraq, arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles
NEVENT : Spy planes are searching for more banned arms, and Iraqi scientists are being interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors
NEVENT : Back with us to talk about it, two Congressmen: J.D
NEVENT : Hayworth, the Republican from Arizona, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont
NEVENT : But I want to ask you a question
NEVENT : The answer is, these are my neighbors from Vermont and obviously we're going to support them
NEVENT : But let's be clear
NEVENT : The president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position against world opinion
NEVENT : Didn't the Congress support it
NEVENT : I thought you voted for it
NEVENT : I did not vote for it
NEVENT : I mean the Congress
NEVENT : The majority rules
