actions|All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone
actions|The cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy
suits|the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits

donations|Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by millions of dollars per hour
donations|Although the need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort
received|This is why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in South Asia
donations|They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now

bankrupcy|the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
bankruptcy|Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different
bankruptcy|I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life
bankruptcy|Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts
bankruptcy|That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors
bankruptcy|If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
bankruptcy|My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004
give|If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005

bankrupcy|Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
bankrupcy|Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
bankruptcy|Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares
bankruptcy|A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee
bankruptcy|If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him

parole|What's the deal with parole
parole|Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time
parole|Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary
parole|If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last
parole|and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
parole|So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
parole|Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release

release|Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
release|Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law

parole|You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind
parole|You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
takes|and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
parole|And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again
leave|So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule

sentence|It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts
sentence|You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out

election|In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out
election|The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable
election|If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a success by any measure," that's good enough for me
election|You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq

fired|Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
fired|Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000
fire|Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away

transfer|It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
sold|We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville
reductions|Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere
moving|Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade

re)merger|There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that
ceased|Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist
founded|The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved

election|The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20% of the population
election|If so, should that affect the legitimacy of the election
election|A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
elections|The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops
election|The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy
elected|But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will
elections|These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement
vote|If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis
election|Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain
election|In addition, they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not restricted their election related activities

war|I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years
war|To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war

attacked|The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
attack|One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future
attacked|Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US
attack|This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US
sent|However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort
battle|Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed

war|It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
war|The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel
war|Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry

war|The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it
war|While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control
war|For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China
war|To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal
fight|Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler
attack|An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies
war|Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years

electoral|confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College
electoral|The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all
war|This would have delayed secession and the Civil War
protests|Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate, wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40% of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow

slaughter|You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC
died|I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps
killed|As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000
murder|The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't
died|Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
deaths|This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for
liquidation|It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live, surely
email|I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive

arrested|Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails
murder|Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just trying to get it into perspective
killed|I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small
convicted|Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable

holocaust|Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to Holocaust Day
holocaust|I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future

gives|Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel
fight|And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership role
fight|We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know, doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country

conquered|I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis

war|Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, study international affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit about him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time, longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace with the Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or)) divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war and terrorists in the area
conflict|It's a matter of, uh -- I mean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um, hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um, they don't like each other
conflict|I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the conflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh- For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for Israel and another one for Palestine
death|Death of Arafat
died|Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
death|Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
died|What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
conflict|But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh, became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President Bush time
invasion|For example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval
met|For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement
found|Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
born|Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess
killed|But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
murder|Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly
murdering|Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
trials|Criminal Trials
unborn|Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
trial|There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial
trial|Why do you think this trial has been so publicized
trials|What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention, and why
trial|What's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall
trial|Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial
get|And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison
charge|But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
got|And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
got|And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
get|So he didn't get both first degree murders
charge|And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
give|And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
married|And actually I don't even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two
found|And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges
election|Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
election|ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think, and this last election showed that both are very brutal
election|Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year- old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated in
elections|Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you
election|It was a very brutal election
elected|and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that I'm really not really I don't like their policies
retired|And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was my thinking
terrorism|Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
tragedy|Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
fought|and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
election|Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
election|Um, man I thought I, uh,  put this whole election stuff behind me
elections|And, um, elections wore me down
elections|Yeah, I- in fact, I thought we already had a discussion on this, uh, about elections some time back, but I guess it was -- question was framed differently, I guess
suing|and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
election|Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
election|So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates
meetings|And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him
conflict|And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way
attack|Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could
attack|But do you think, um -- that -- and this isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to be another attack on the ~US
conflict|I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time
war|hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war

killed|You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know

acts|There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts
terrorism|So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways, a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the Israelis
overthrown|But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've been kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians
died|PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death

use|u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it

elected|In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat
fire|By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly
deaths|This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings
bombings|Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades

activity|A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity
incidents|But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
blind|Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
attack|The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
use|But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
attacks|Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
attacks|However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
cause|It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
selling|Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
blind|A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
visited|Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
use|They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
threat|I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
flying|However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
fund|While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology

death|One is the death of Yasser Arafat

paid|Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it

former|Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
slaughter|In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
killings|It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
genocide|A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
massacres|She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
genocide|The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
genocide|It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
genocide|The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
genocide|Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
holocaust|But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
sending|She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
genocide|Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
genocide|The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide
fax|Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned

merger|Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early

buys|But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
buying|For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
sold|Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
lawsuit|As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
acquiring|Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines
takeover|And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt
swallowed|And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith

leaves|Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves
accused|Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action
lent|Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least
given|While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack
pay|Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate
offer|I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away
acquire|In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire
bought|Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals

conference|The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business
conference|I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School
turnover|Is there high turnover among senior managers
previous|If the CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous company
retire|But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire
left|Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG
departure|Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter
left|I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left
lawsuit|Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status
action|Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004
filings|The results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy & technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady

replaced|You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced
new|It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job
folding|Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely
bankruptcy|So I will thankfully accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy
layoff|Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees
abandoned|Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme
