elected|In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat
fire|By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly
deaths|This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings

incidents|But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
blind|Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
attack|The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
use|But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
attacks|Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
attacks|However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
cause|It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
selling|Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
blind|A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
visited|Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
use|They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
threat|I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
flying|However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports

paid|Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it

former|Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
slaughter|In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
killings|It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
genocide|A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
massacres|She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
genocide|The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
genocide|It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
genocide|The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
genocide|Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
holocaust|But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
sending|She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
genocide|Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
genocide|The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide
fax|Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned

walk|How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest
collapse|Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's
pay|The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets
bankruptcy|The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country
bought|It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo
winning|Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver
won|Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction
sell|everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber
sued|Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued, and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do 2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we Merckers might be safe
replaced|It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies
dismemberment|The Capital Spectator reports on the latest: Not only China, but India's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade
merger|Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early

buys|But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
buying|For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
sold|Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
lawsuit|As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
acquiring|Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines
takeover|And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt
swallowed|And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith
deal|And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody
leaves|Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves
accused|Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action
lent|Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least
given|While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack
pay|Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate
offer|I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away
acquire|In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire
bought|Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals
nominating|I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away

conference|In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School
conference|Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference
met|I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world
conference|The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business
conference|I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School
turnover|Is there high turnover among senior managers
previous|If the CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous company
retire|But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire
left|Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG
departure|Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter
left|I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left
lawsuit|Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status
action|Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004
filings|The results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy & technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady

replaced|You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced
new|It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job
folding|Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely
bankruptcy|So I will thankfully accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy
layoff|Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees
abandoned|Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme
