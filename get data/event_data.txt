Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long-term "peace camp" alliance following the end of war in Iraq, government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend
But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq

Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long-term "peace camp" alliance following the end of war in Iraq, government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend
The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protect his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin officials
Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furious front-page headline: "The United States is demanding that Russia, France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war
Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post-war revival of Iraq

It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washington will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war stance
Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve friendly relations with the United States than the pro-European, anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign and defense ministries

Thousands of Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam's founder Prophet Mohammed
The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam, calling for good government
The demonstration came as Iraq's top US overseer Paul Bremer began his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the country

We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that precipitously," said a source at the Organisation of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which is administering post-war Iraq

Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on May 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman daily that elections should be held under international supervision

Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising
Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Beit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said
The handover is a credibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show it means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting attacks on the Jewish state

The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999, but disagreements over treatment kept the project on hold
Meanwhile, South Korean officials said Cabinet-level talks scheduled this week between the two Koreas looked unlikely to take place
Seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions
Seoul had hoped to use the three-day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world
The Security Council's ``handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war,'' the spokesman said
If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S. efforts to ``stifle'' North Korea, it would leave the North with ``no other option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all the potentials,'' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
For months, North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty
But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S. invasion of Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international agreements
For weeks, North Korea has claimed that the United States plans to attack it after Iraq
North Korea called off two working-level talks with South Korea last month
North Korea on Sunday rejected the U.N. Security Council's plan to discuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development, calling it ``a prelude to war

The lawyer of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was reprimanded by a Lusaka magistrate when his client failed to appear in court on theft charges Friday
Chiluba, who is accused of stealing millions of dollars while in office, did not appear at the Lusaka magistrates court as scheduled because he has filed an appeal to have case heard at a higher court
Chiluba faces 65 counts of theft including that of 15 billion kwacha (US$3 million) in cash from the Zambia National Commercial Bank in Lusaka
He came to office in 1991 and served two five-year terms

And, broad opposition to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists
After Sept. 11, 2001, Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S. President George W. Bush's global war on terror
And, currently, both have opposed the U.S.- led war on Iraq
Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S. policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta
Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to be repealed
Yet, Washington maintains a 12-year ban on arms sales to the world's most populous Muslim nation with the aim of curbing human rights abuses still happening despite momentous political change
But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and arms sales
The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's main weapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million in the 1980s
Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travels to Moscow to seek the Kremlin's help in modernizing her increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed forces
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa says Megawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis
Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these were severed after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965
In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor
In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independence referendum
The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia

I don't think we'll discover anything, myself,'' Rumsfeld said at a meeting with Pentagon employees
A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Barzan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam's regime since 1998, but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime's inner circle

The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. war against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction
Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N. international staff, including the inspectors, to leave Iraq just before the war began on March 20
Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposed the war
This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq
The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams to Iraq to search for illegal weapons

As the US-led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad and the second Iraqi city of Basra, Blair and Bush agreed there would be a "vital role" for the United Nations in post-war Iraq
It was a "false choice" to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition forces or the United Nations, said Blair, who was believed to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush

Yet, analysts argued, both Britain and the United States hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations such as France, Germany and Russia
Blair also pleaded the world to avoid "endless diplomatic wrangles" over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said Monday that it was prepared to exchange prisoners with the government despite the death of 10 hostages held by the rebel group
On May 5, 10 hostages held by the FARC were killed during an attempt to rescue them by the army
The rebels "in any case cannot allow to have its prisoners to be taken away by enemy forces without a military response," he added
The 17,000-strong FARC, the largest guerrilla force in Colombia, has been fighting a war against the government for more than 40 years, leaving 400,000 dead

Reyes said in his letter that the "guerrilla units are in the moral obligation of saving and protecting lives and physical integrity of their prisoners
Estrada, who was ousted in a military-backed popular revolt in January 2001, has been detained for almost two years at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Metro Manila on plunder charges
This is an old tune as far as the Palace is concerned," Tiglao said hours after Estrada petitioned the anti-graft court, the Sandiganbayan, to dismiss the government charges against him, citing "lack of jurisdiction" since he was still the president
The Sandiganbayan Special Division Friday reset for June 16 the resumption of Estrada's plunder case hearing, which was originally scheduled for June 2

Before the sentence, there had been speculations among analysts on whether Waksal would get leniency because his company has been working on researches of cancer drugs, a good endeavor in the eyes of many people
Sam Waksal, founder of the US pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems was sentenced to 87 months in prison Tuesday for insider trading
Waksal was also ordered to pay more than 4 million dollars in fines and back taxes
Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate malfeasance, Waksal pleaded guilty in October to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company' s stock in late 2001

Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother's wedding this weekend because they are not LDS
Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
I got a sort of an icky feeling when I realized the only people who did attend the kid's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father, who suffers from Alzheimers
The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide
There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whose bishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town, so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well
He insisted that he needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that she really needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was not LDS
Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage didn't last
I can't help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making our marriage a gospel focused one
For my part though, I think we started the marriage with a compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price
I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple

Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
I really think it's time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often in a more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing
I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely
Hmm... I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony, and went on later to be happily sealed
I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of state
Perhaps my exwife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now
I think divorce is really stupid
Divorce really sucks

Either its bad or good
I know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures, a lot of friendship, a lot of love
Oh, yeah, it wasn't perfect
I was one of the first digital camera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage
They say it takes one year for every two that you were married
Especially for those of us who still have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I've still got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have
We're going to a bed and breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax
If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together, maybe even getting married
My mother took his remarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that
I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even though I really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride
Dell is involved in a class action suit for "bait and switch", where a nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items, and for promising "easy credit" for which no one qualifies and then charges ridiculously high interest rates
All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone
The cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy
the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits
i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers

Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit
It seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line
The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers
Doing the right thing provides no protection from class action
i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit

Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago
So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers
Since companies are going to be sued in class action, regardless of the merits of the case, the threat of a class action is not a detriment
If you don't believe that, witness the Vioxx lawsuits
Because of that, it is being sued
They are not being sued
The Red Cross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administratice costs
Just give carefully. if you are going to give assistance then LOOK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $$$
I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami
Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity
I've heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their donations, with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses
It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donations earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will go directly toward aid
So that is the channel we chose for our own donation
9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds
Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by millions of dollars per hour
Although the need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort
This is why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in South Asia
They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now
So they didn't discourage donations to them per se, just not for this specific area
Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children

The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you're below .05
In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys, which supposedly landed in his lap
Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside, keys in my pocket, but I've decided I'll take the train home later
The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he wasn't on a public road when the cop arrested him

I am the head of a company that raised an angel round of financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never physically met initially
the CEOS and execs of companies such as Fred Smith of FEDEX, Norman Waitt Of Gateway, Jeff Skoll of Ebay, Roger Marino of EMC, Marc Turtletaub of The Money Store, Marc Cuban/Todd Wagner, and others have all parked their money in film ventures and deals similar to ours
I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently exited executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment reasons
I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth
Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still remember though the pain I felt

I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool (not available round here
If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool
So don't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful
If you don't have an institutional water birth available, have you considered just staying home
I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful
My girlfriend was on the run from probation in Fla when she got herself in trouble here in Az
Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
2 "FTA"s (failure to appear), one in FL and one in AZ, plus whatever the original charges were in both cases
All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask, and the AZ jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation
They let her serve her time in AZ, then they come and get her to serve her time in FL
It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another
Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA
But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether

The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her

On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy
Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home
At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him
I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
He was cited for simple assault and battery
According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment
A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital
So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am
So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
A nurse said, "He beat two of us up
I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that
I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident
According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone

Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big enough to get some serious attention
the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different
I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life
Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts
That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors
If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004
If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005
the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004

Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares
A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee

A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s

I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill
I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK

He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time
You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until yesterday
The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed, and still they could not catch him

What's the deal with parole
Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time
Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary
If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last
and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release

Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law

You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind
You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again

It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts

Also, you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess

The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the governor's election is Washington State because there were some "errors" in the process
So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent
In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but also "perfect

In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out
The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable
If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a success by any measure," that's good enough for me
You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq
Of course, the Republicans would have thought the WA State election *was* perfect, had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared
Everyone, everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government
Think about this objectively (forget the US is involved), if a foreign country invaded another and set up elections, wouldn't a reasonable person question the validity of the election results

Even if you, John H, believe the US held impartial elections in Iraq, don't you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid, or least suspect
Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles
Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero
Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000
Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away
Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day

It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year

John McCrary resigned from the board as a result
It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open
At scholastic tournaments, no cash prizes are paid
However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately

It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville
Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere
Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened -- not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had a stockpile of WMDs
Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade

so you believe him when he says that iran isn't looking for it, but you don't believe the US when we say that we aren't
but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran
that is the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti-war people wanted for iraq
The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate
There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that
Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist
The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved
Swenson herself would also leave the NCA
Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal
In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded

To put it simply (for your benefit): Lincoln spoke *of* God, demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities (their religious beliefs among them) than differences
and he has made the point repeatedly in interview after interview that he has never claimed to speak for god, nor has he claimed that this is "god's war

The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20% of the population
If so, should that affect the legitimacy of the election
A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops
The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy
But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will
These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement
If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis
Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain
In addition, they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not restricted their election related activities
The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they didn't vote
It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote
If anyone has a right to call the elections "illegitimate" it would be the shi'ites
A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote
They faced, however, no pressure from the rest of the country, nor from the "occupying" forces to stay away from the vote
You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day
If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding
America invasion, occupation Iraqis are unprovoked

Again, America has LPDR under its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground units from Laos
Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connection to China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations
Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number of Arabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty of Hmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming Sino-US war
Read between the lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea

If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then there will be no bloodshed in Laos
Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate, the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China
These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to be the fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the Miao Rebellions
This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight for their own country

Saddam posed a threat to Saudia, Kuwait, and the British oil protectorates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded, stupid
The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars
Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility

Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran

How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran

How about Saddam's use of chemical weapons
Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers
How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
Saddam was so unimpressed by Iraqi casualties, he invaded Kuwait barely two years after the UN-imposed ceasefire
With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them

I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years
To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war

I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front

The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future
Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US
This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US
However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort
Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed

However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions

This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936
It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel
Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry
This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war
The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it
While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control
For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China
To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal
Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler
An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies
Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years

confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College
The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all
This would have delayed secession and the Civil War
Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate, wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40% of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow
Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote
WI it was only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas? I believe Douglas would have won

You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC
I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps
As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000
The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't
Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for
It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live, surely
I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive
The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices
The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state
Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails
Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just trying to get it into perspective
I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small
Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable

Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to Holocaust Day
I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future

This morning, when talking about the horrors of Auswitch on the BBC Breakfast programme, they referred to the slaughter of thousands of Jews and others
I'd like to see the Greens run David Cobb again
You know, I I mean obviously, if Schwarzenegger could run, he's got the name recognition, but I would be really surprised -- both to see him run and to see him win, but then again -- I was a little bit surprised when he won California, so

And with the constant merging with other banks
The uh ~CEO we had before we merged with Nations Bank -- he uh -- he about ran as into the ground with some hedge funds that he had gone into
And then, and then when we finish merging, they give the guy something like a twenty-five million dollar package, and if he dies, his family still gets all the money
The uh ~CEO we had before we merged with Nations Bank -- he uh -- he about ran as into the ground with some hedge funds that he had gone into
And that was a long time ago, and we just c- oh, all that money,  for just about bankrupting us
They because they got some better insurance policies and some better -- bonuses that they paid out at the end of the month and -- you know, it was a little better
I'm not Hispanic, but they uh I've hired uh
I've got a a manager that -- you know, she's -- I defer to her on who thinks whether she thinks I should hire somebody or not
I've got a girl that I've hired uh well, I hired her, let's see, about nine years ago -- It's a Hispanic girl but she speaks fluent English and Spanish, so she can work with both -- you know either language problem

I I'm sorry to see Colin Powell leave, leaving
He he's very honest, he's very strong in his beliefs, and I'm sorry to see him go
I'm also sorry to see Tom Ridge resigning
he before nine eleven, he was -- he was on an advisory committal -- committee -- to the Gover- to the President I guess,  besides him running uh Pennsylvania, and then after nine eleven they appointed him you know, head of Homeland Security, and then created the
uh and just wipe it out

it's so soon -- since nine eleven, and he has been creating his own job, i- in essence, because it's such a new position
Um -- one -- two of the men are from New York, one is a Head of -- the the -- who was there at nine eleven
Where's he going to Commerce
Is that where he's headed

You know who I would name
If you were president, which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why
Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term
Who are they, and why do you think they should be appointed
That's sort of unusual in these calls, in my experience so far
Let's see, my first call I got was from Russia
Eh uh I -- I heard uh that Colin Powell wanted um -- to resign last year and they talked him out of it
Oh thi- you were surprised that he yo- that he decided to step down
They're appointing her ta- to a new position, and I was surprised about Ashcroft
Ashcroft surprised me a little bit um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so
I think that's why Al-Qaeda -- took down the the uh twin towers
So who would y- what would you appoint him to
And Condoleezza Rice is going to step into that position, the way I understand it, uh

If you were president, which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why
And the one that, oh what's the -- the guy that, um -- Tom Ridge just re- resigned yesterday
But I heard that they were going to -- one of the possible candidates is the the guy he used to be the chief of police of New York
Well, the homeless people -- I guess, they need their shopping cart, so they kind of went elsewhere, so -- um -- I mean it's a small thing,  but it was, they just figured out, they were -- you know, uh -- learning from experience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- I think he would be a good -- candidate for the Homeland Security,  running that
Um -- like, uh -- well, it was -- Colin Powell was Secretary, was he Secretary of State
Uh, do you think there is uh -- some other, uh like -- positions has to be has been -- has to be created, like uh -- for the next election

Who are they, and why do you think they should be appointed
If you were president, which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why
I think -- I think Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor -- for nine eleven
Well, I I'm a New Yorker, and I got to tell you that I I think nine eleven I I think -- basically made him
Exactly, exactly, I I think that nine eleven made him and
And if if if I don't think the rest of the country knows that, because they don't know what he did before nine eleven, because they don't pay any attention
I didn't particularly like the the tone about the the religious uh -- side of -- the that election
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
But you know what, it's like I think they didn't want to find him guilty because remember when ~OJ was not found guilty
But you know what, it's like I think they didn't want to find him guilty because remember when ~OJ was not found guilty
I- it just, I don't know what would happen if he was found guilty, but now I think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know, okay, we're not going to let this guy walk, like, don't let this guy walk either, big high profile case
I- it just, I don't know what would happen if he was found guilty, but now I think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know, okay, we're not going to let this guy walk, like, don't let this guy walk either, big high profile case
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
Okay, I -- have been following the trial, I don't know why, ever since this whole thing happened
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
I don't think he's guilty and, I hope he doesn't get the death penalty
You could tell both of them uh you look some of the things they had, you know,  he had a few bucks or so. (()) finish, things were getting him down, uh you know, you know how it is, day after day though -- M- marriage isn't all that wonderful
I don't, I don't know why like his uh, the wife's or the mother said divorce is an option I think
Not, you know, not murder and, oh, I mean, I don't know
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
Um,  uh, Scott Peterson trial
Yeah, because I was really -- I wasn't really following it that much because I was
Yeah, I heard something about it
And the trial's there
Where the trial's at
but -- ((but I'd love to have his hair)) something just came off the ~TV about the Scott trial
I live in Redwood City, which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it
I live in Redwood City, which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it
Yeah, we're a pretty small town, so our newspaper covers it a lot
So, it's, you know, and the trial, the, um,  what is it called, the verdict, was actually read by audio over the ~TV
You know, we're close to the trial so of course it's going to be in the newspaper every single day
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her, so he panicked
Um, they brought the boat down, or a duplicate of the boat to, kind of, you know, get a feel for it but they had to remove it from Redwood City because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory of Laci and, you know, planting flowers around it and stuff, so it was pretty interesting
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Hopefully, you know, if he's guilty hopefully, you know, they find him guilty -- and hopefully they have evidence, you know
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Where he had committed the murders, so
Is that -- is that the one where somebody called a news
I think he got into an argument with her and he pushed her
And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her, so he panicked
Once they sentence him ((I bet
Um, they brought the boat down, or a duplicate of the boat to, kind of, you know, get a feel for it but they had to remove it from Redwood City because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory of Laci and, you know, planting flowers around it and stuff, so it was pretty interesting
Because somebody had -- called the news people
I don't know if they've, I don't know if they've -- um -- given him the death penalty yet
But I think he would be the first in, in a really long time to actually -- be killed
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and dumped her in, uh -- the ocean, basically
I i don't know. I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, the woman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way of changing that I guess
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive
Oh, but the mistress had nothing to do with the murder
I hear though, that he's going to be -- the first person to be (()) um -- uh -- killed for a crime in California in like, thirty five years or something
Um -- why, uh, now why did they decide that this was to be this big (()) out of this with the most heinous crime in all of California
I mean I guess that's not how they decide who died, but it's because of the
they have many many worse crimes going on in California, parents killing their children and everything, that you would think -- would would, um -- you know, be
I mean there's like, genocide in Sudan right now but like, nobody talks about that
Oh yeah and what's going on in, I know and people -- flock, flock to the store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it's like what are you -- doing
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
I didn't really follow the trial very closely at all
we don't have, uh, cable so we purposely didn't watch the trial, but I read about it on the internet
we don't have, uh, cable so we purposely didn't watch the trial, but I read about it on the internet
I i don't know. I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV and and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, the woman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way of changing that I guess
Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized
But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like human rights violations going on all around the world
Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch, you know
How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial
Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
When I first -- heard the case,  or about it,  I -- told myself,  if he did do it
because they're -- I've never totally -- believed -- that Peterson did this all by himself
that if -- she had anything to do with this,  I don't think he would ever tell
Yeah, he probably did
and I think he did
uh, if he did do it,  I -- thought to myself,  he will probably get -- the maximum sentence of whatever it is
Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted of
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive
Did the -- are they still going to try to get him with, uh,  the death penalty or are they -- -- or are they going to be content with just, uh,  just, you know, giving him life, uh, have heard about that
Did the -- are they still going to try to get him with, uh,  the death penalty or are they -- -- or are they going to be content with just, uh,  just, you know, giving him life, uh, have heard about that
uh, if he did do it,  I -- thought to myself,  he will probably get -- the maximum sentence of whatever it is
Well, he he he probably will, yeah
I c- but, now, I don't know that I would vote for a death penalty because I'm not sure that a -- a death cancels out a death
I c- but, now, I don't know that I would vote for a death penalty because I'm not sure that a -- a death cancels out a death
I'm not -- -- I I don't know, and -- I wouldn't really be able to vote -- on that because my father was killed at work
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that

How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial

Uh, there there's something about this Scott Peterson trial, though, that the th- that I can't I can't recall hearing
In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison
In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison
Well, uh they're coming up to the sentencing, and I heard yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that his brother -- I guess it was on the television

I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I didn't watch the trial at all
I read about it in the newspaper and things like that
I know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it
I- I think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary
Death of Arafat
Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I don't really know very well
Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel
And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership role
We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know, doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country
Other topics -- you know, usually about the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um, to say
Death of Arafat
Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening, a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the United States that make it
Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent
They had those retreats and things with the leaders
Death of Arafat
Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
I think that, um,  his death -- marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace
I think that now he's gone, his family is still around, and
but it wasn't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to ((send)) the Israelis out of Jerusalem in the areas that they wanted
If you know the Bible well you would know that there's always going to be a conflict there
I'd like to -- I know that,  you know, there's been problems, a lot of conflict over there, and it seems like no matter what
And I agree that we shouldn't send people over there
just like Iraq ye- eh, we try to go in and get peace and- and how long has it been and,  I mean, I think Saddam needed to be removed but it's- -- there's just -- s- all these people that are going to follow him no matter what
I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis
Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
I don't think that we should get involved to a level, a point where we're sending people over there and, um, trying to -- help keep the peace or anything like that,  um
I was more,  um,  kind of a -- I was a kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that wasn't a,  you know, one of my topics of interest at the time, it is now
Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, study international affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit about him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time, longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace with the Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or)) divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war and terrorists in the area
It's a matter of, uh -- I mean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um, hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um, they don't like each other
I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the conflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh- For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for Israel and another one for Palestine
Death of Arafat
Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh, became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President Bush time
For example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval
For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement
I think,  the people,  uh,  the people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess
But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
Criminal Trials
Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial
Why do you think this trial has been so publicized
What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention, and why
What's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall
Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial
And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison
But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
So he didn't get both first degree murders
And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
And actually I don't even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two
And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges
Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think, and this last election showed that both are very brutal
Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year- old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated in
Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you
It was a very brutal election
and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that I'm really not really I don't like their policies
And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was my thinking
Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
In fact, we just got back from Disney World,  you know, about an hour ago and they're down there and they're but they're both, uh
and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
Um, man I thought I, uh,  put this whole election stuff behind me
And, um, elections wore me down
Yeah, I- in fact, I thought we already had a discussion on this, uh, about elections some time back, but I guess it was -- question was framed differently, I guess
and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates
And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him
And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way
Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could
But do you think, um -- that -- and this isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to be another attack on the ~US
You know, it's been going on for all these many -- what
I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time
hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader
Death of Arafat
What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him, I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now
It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned
Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send over some very -- low level state department person
But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think, uh,  I can understand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory
Death of Arafat
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or it it should be a change for the ~PLO
He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements
You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know
And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to, you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, you know
Death of Arafat
What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know
They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore
And it's and it's it's you know,  a war of attrition
It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it was poisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it
Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when they when -- basically the state of Israel was formed
Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there were Jewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish people started going there and they j- basically just- you know, they just took over
There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts
So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways, a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the Israelis
But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've been kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in terms of his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of years uh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something
And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle
And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle

Death of Arafat
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
They were doing all these talks in Camp David and and it should have just continued when Br- Bush came into office

yeah, they're- where they're coming home from the war and they -- yeah, they're- they're pretty much homeless and- and ha- they have nothing
You know, you're sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know
We're going over there, we're saying,  look, this is how we do it -- and, um, i- -- so we think everybody else should be that way
The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
War in Iraq
right -- a little bit right after the war started in Iraq there was a soldier that spoke out and he got reprimanded for it
uh, spoke out against the war publicly and he got reprimanded for it
I have -- my cousin's getting ready to go over there and it just, oh, it just makes me sick
But my dad was in the army and he was in Vietnam war and he's like, this is crazy, you know

I- I didn't know they could send them more than once
Eh, he quit, or he resigned
That's why his father didn't want to invade Iraq, because of all these problems they're having now
Look at what happened a couple days ago, they killed, um,  like seventy people
I don't know why- how he got elected, I mean, there's a lot of people that did vote
Well, but, I mean, you know, I don't see what he's doing, I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there

The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
Much of the country is unstable, but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January
Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what

And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this
I just talked to somebody from ~LA a couple days ago about that on the -- survey line
Yeah, I think the -- I think they're still they're going to go through even though, uh, even though,  um, what's it called,  that you know of all the -- turmoil that's happening there and all of the argu- you know, and all the -- killings and everything
They kept on scheduling them and they we're saying, oh, no no no, you know
Um,  yeah, I think -- you know I think they should have continued to go through with it, and you know um -- if- if there is -- if there's problems, you know, just -- still -- don't, you know -- just ignore it, keep going, you know you can't -- stop, you know,if you already started something, you know, you should complete it, I think
I know they set up the council,  uh, interim council, but that hasn't gone,  you know, perfe- smoothly
So, if they can just sort of make a -- be- get into more of a supportive role and,  you know, flex their muscles when they need to and maybe that will help- help,  uh,  squall some of the vi- the violence
I don't know if that could, uh,  if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just that- that -- a lot of that's, you know,  uh, weapons and terrorists have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from Syria
Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what
Even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on American shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge now leads
And these bozos let four armed Cubans land on our shores when they're trying to make a high terrorist alert
He lost an election to a dead man
Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office
Hire professionals, Mr. President
It's OK to put Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department if they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right
Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination
He explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security, the economy and judicial nominations
It could swell to as much as $500 billion if we go to war in Iraq
In all, two million Americans have lost their jobs under President Bush so far, not to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic team
Orders went out today to deploy 17,000 U.S. Army soldiers in the Persian Gulf region
We're talking about possibilities of full scale war with former Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine
And gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father-in-law killed him
And gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father-in-law killed him
Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war
Any rational person hates war
Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war
Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to war a nation goes to war

And so I would like you to take a look at the CNN/"USA TODAY"/Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to go to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power

Ask them about going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most distable and volatile regions in the world

We're talking about possibilities of full scale war with former Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine
He's now national director of Win Without War, and former Congressman Bob Dornan, Republican of California
Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time
Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows he wasn't the most stable of people

Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war
They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, what the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to this war
That's going to have to be last war, unfair and unfortunate as that is
I'm chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note
Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operations officer
If the budget goes through as is, why don't Mr. Begala and Mr. Carville just donate the extra tax money they don't want
I'll donate to the Democrats
He had to sue to become our president, and he keeps trying to bribe other countries' democratic governments into his supporting his agenda
And now how are people going to argue that the U.S. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism, specifically al Qaeda
We go to war in Iraq, 200,000 people start protesting in Pakistan, they put too much pressure on the government
We go to war in Iraq, it would be the worst thing we can do
What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when I thought that was his job

Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured
Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured
That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it
And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state
The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage

Can you say that the lawyers, the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy
Can you say that the lawyers, the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy

There was a hear on Capitol Hill today
He's the father of a little girl, 13-month-old girl, who he said today died because of medical malpractice
She died awaiting surgery
Does that look like a Lottery winner to you, holding a picture of his dead baby
But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you, who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000 for the loss of a child
That's why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation
And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state

If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic costs, economic losses
Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience
And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National Practitioners Databank
Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays
Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy
Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience

Here's what the "Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations
Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits, it's too many
Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking about horrific injuries here, even file a claim
Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience
It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors
If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine
Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right
Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor
Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment
Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system
But here in Washington, President Bush says it's all a hoax, and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war
Congressman Sanders, you're opposed to this war
When the guns begin to fire, when the American men and women are in harm's way and may be dying, is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops
Well it's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqi women and children are killed, and when young men and women in this country are unnecessarily put at harm's risk, what should we do
And obviously we're going to pray that there's fewer casualties
Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets
No, I don't demonstrate against anybody during a war
No, I don't demonstrate against anybody during a war
What I do know is Saddam Hussein has butchered over a million of his own citizens
Furthermore, the United States supported him in the war against Iran
What we're talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war

You don't know what happens when the most powerful nation on Earth invades and occupies a Muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people
You don't know what happens when the most powerful nation on Earth invades and occupies a Muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people
I'm not crazy about it myself
No, it's so important -- you know this -- and I know it's fun and we love doing partisan Punch & Judy, but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war
For example -- wait a second -- in Iran, the reason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah
You who put the Shah in power
But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
But I mean you're attacking the CIA for putting him in, when it was -- the problem was Khomeini
The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies
The same weekend they arrested the guy, we had
And I'm curious, how can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught
We had no part in it
No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan
Why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq
The question of whether we go to war or not is strictly a national question
On this Ash Wednesday, the pope asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for peace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war
We don't need war
They're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war
The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein
President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get
It doesn't mean we have to go to war
But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force
It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein
Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force
I'm saying we don't need to use force right now
Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn't
Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show
Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal
A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives
You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation
You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation
I used to work there
but they shouldn't fire a guy for his political views
Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decided to run for president
You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post, being an ambassador or a governor or some thing
In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm
Later, the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side
Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda
And how'd they get them
Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King
One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment
You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
Isn't that wrong in a time of war
You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
One of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror of war
If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world
You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest
Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're arresting
Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people
We should do all of those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the
They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it's no big deal there
And the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world
I mean, what happens if India decides that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan
I don't think we have to kill to prove that
That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
I think it's unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil
The people are against it
Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky and kooky fans and friends and critics right in
Don from Denver, Colorado writes, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to Iraq" -- which I do
Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes, "France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq
But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not
I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq
That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil
Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is because they have democracies
He's trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers
What does that have to do with the war in Iraq
On the other hand, the region is pretty unstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm
And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran
And my question is, after today's meeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is it old Europe
Who sends troops to die on our side
We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some
We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some
So what is it like for them to face combat far from home
For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories
There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people

Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire
A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead
Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone
Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes
Duke, what's it like to kill somebody
And I went to the priest, because it bothered me
I knew I could do it again
But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did
And it still does
War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing

Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam

Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety
Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety
If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion, out of bravery
Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud, decorated combat veterans
It's just, a decade later, killing still troubles the soul
Did you do it again
I shot down four more MiGs
As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing
We know where they're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition
Well, as coalition forces push north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy
Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq

Eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq
This programming note, tomorrow at noon Eastern I'll have a special interview with the nation's top military officer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
They're expecting a total at this particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24-hour period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle East according to the Pentagon
They're saying there will be 1500 sorties in a 24-hour period ending tomorrow

Some of the 40,000 British troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them
And today's parts in this conflict, this kind of work becomes more and more important

He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombing similar to this
Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra, two members - claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering

At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism
It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable
No injuries reported
Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact
They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad
You're looking at live pictures of Baghdad where there have been more strikes, more bombs dropped, more missiles this evening and of course as always, CNN keeping a close eye, a close watch, a close listen on what's going on in Baghdad

The Iraqis arrested looked bemused (ph) and plead innocence but with many militia here, pretending to surrender only to open fire on their captors later, first impressions can be deceptive and lethal

A man in this vehicle took a pot shot at the commandos
It was a painful and bloody mistake
We sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and we took about 12 or 13 prisoners, three or four enemy were injured and they've now been flown out and we're treating them including a man who is almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest

Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise
They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States
Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today
The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that
Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief
Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas
Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market, if that had been a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated
Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in that direction as well
Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town of Kalak in northern Iraq
He just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away
Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling

Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak which of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish (ph) forces, we've been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been bombing the ridge line behind us
Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours

Rusty, what sort of crowd is showing up there
As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident
In trucks and on foot they came to the town of Safwan
When we come back, one of the many sad aspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for
When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops
Hopefully it will be a short war
These people have been without food or water supplies since the war began
We hate any state in war here
Hopefully it will be a short war
It will be attack the Iraqi regime
Delivery drivers were threatened
One of the buses in our convoy was held up at knifepoint
The troops have moved into Safwan
When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops
We'll check out some of the demonstrations
Here in the United States this weekend just as they did last weekend, anti-war protesters taking to the street
In Los Angeles, the International Black Coalition for Peace and Justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today
This has been a very peaceful demonstration
This has been a very peaceful demonstration
Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration
In the meantime further north in California, San Francisco is the setting today for a rally aimed at boosting the moral of the American troops in the Persian Gulf region
This has been a very peaceful demonstration
As I said, the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that has ever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War
This has been a very peaceful demonstration
Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration
Well Judy, this is the largest group really we've seen of the support the troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks
Of course this is the home of the anti- war demonstrations stemming back to the Vietnam War but there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people

How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE) population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us
Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor
Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racing across the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle
Just ahead we'll have the latest on today's suicide bombing in Israel
It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad
It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad
We've had an absolutely terrific story, pushing forward north toward Baghdad
Seventy-two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road
Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, "There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed
We have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles

There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March 27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack
We will be back later on the war in Iraq
It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led war against Iraq
Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the U.S.-led war against Iraq
But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
Dozens, though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to an eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather
But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
CNN's Kelly Wallace reports on today's attack in Netanya
Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon
As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility
According to a leaflet from the group obtained by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians with the people of Iraq
And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
Many here though say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber

Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the general direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward
Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad
There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process

Our embedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving faster than commanders expected
Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs
U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
Our Walter Rodgers is embedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd Infantry Division's march toward the Iraqi capital
There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
Earlier in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala with a minimum of fight
There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack guns
The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the direction of the 7th Cavalry
The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
This as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad
The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning
The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle
Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses in and around Karbala
They were then able to advance far north of that city and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad
That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the battlefront
So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground
The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the regime is gone
Let's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it

Judy, in the next hour, on our special "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS," I'm going to be speaking live to her older brother who is in the Army, her younger sister who wants to be in the Army, just around the same time as Jessica is going to be arriving at Ramstein, the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment
Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
At the same time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris River crossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there
Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut
But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon
We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains, or anything like that
Additionally, their ability to use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically
Clearly, as we threaten the core of the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up
In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a several-pronged attack

Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago
Could be urban combat
They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed

Simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy
U.S. forces moving ever closer to Baghdad, but military officials say they are not counting on capitulation
Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there
I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government
A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
That means stocks were up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of the war in Iraq
And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that
The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991
They rose up, didn't get American support

A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
There is much fear here of the Saddam loyalists who still hold sway in Basra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates
As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
We will approach Baghdad
The Americans are racing towards Baghdad, the British still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as possible
These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
And to the south, British forces continue their attack on targets around Basra
British troops control the outskirts of the town, and today destroyed another building they said housed Iraqi fighters
But there may first be fighting in the capital, 250 miles to the north
From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq, coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been called a ferocious bombardment

It happened outside the oil-rich city of Kirkuk
This land fell into Iraqi-Kurdish hands without a shot being fired
Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
We are now between the lines, a no man's land of abandoned Iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence, broken by the roar of warplanes and the distant surge of air strikes
And, says the Iraqi opposition, in winning this war
With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war

I will be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war is going
But, as it has from the beginning, air power remains an important part of the battle
In two weeks after the air war began, there is no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis
According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in Iraq
It's a base that was taken over by the coalition last week
But the are no more Iraqis here, the coalition took over this base last week
That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya
And when you arrive there, you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein
What's happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait
There is a lot of fighting in this area
After he told us that, we asked him during his missions, and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him
Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting SA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground
So they're still out there. But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continue to be effective
And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort
We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties into Iraq
What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there to refuel, to stage operations further north
With the power out now in Baghdad, we're getting word that loudspeakers have been blaring in the Iraqi capital, urging citizens to go to the international airport there, presumably to defend it against coalition forces
Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport

In the final push to Baghdad, U.S. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops
And the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city's southern limits
But the Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand
Farther south in Basra, smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today
And in northern Iraq, Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with U.S. military commanders
The forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city
Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert
At daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River

These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from Baghdad
We don't think that the fighting is over yet, and so there are still options available to the regime, including the use of weapons of mass destruction
The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican Guard
The Medina division, which is one of the toughest outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength
Others are down to 50 percent, but there's still one or two divisions around 75, 80, 90 percent of their fighting strength, and they could still put up very stiff resistance, indeed, when the American forces get en masse to Baghdad itself

They have no idea at this time what caused them
And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk a little bit about urban combat
Gravity rules, even in urban combat
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think of that Blackhawk down scenario, Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here
If we move in on Baghdad, and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone
President Bush vows a final push to victory and he mourns the loss of fallen Marines
We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics
It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will

New explosions rock Baghdad after dark
Witnesses say they heard blasts around a presidential complex in the center of the city
ITN reporter James Mates was with the U.S. forces when they moved in to secure the airport
Now, the latest on the fight for control of Baghdad's International Airport
These pictures were taken on the runway just moments after the coalition attack
It lies just 12 miles from Baghdad and will be a key forward base for U.S. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital
More than 300 Iraqi soldiers have been left dead
Some Republican Guard troops fought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex
Outside the airport, the fighting was fierce, but the battle unequal
Outside the airport, the fighting was fierce, but the battle unequal
But the final push into the city could yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all
Have they done so much damage now to Iraqi command and control centers that they can no longer put up a proper fight, or are the best troops simply withdrawing into the city, to fight there street by street

It was either shelled or bombed

By the time they leave Iraq, they're determined Saddam and his Ba'ath Party will have bitten the dust
They're well within striking distance of the mortars and rockets of the Fedayeen militia, but they're prepared to take that risk to try and persuade the people of Basra that they won't desert them, that they'll stick with this however messy it gets

For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat, let's go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard, Miles O'Brien
Now, this is a rural setting, but this could be applied to urban combat, yes
We're going to kind of play it and stop it, and Kelly's going to walk us through, I guess, Urban Combat 101
I'm joined by J. Kelly McCann, our security analyst, a man who's spent a lot of time learning about urban combat
As you make every entry, Miles, there are two dead spots, one, of course, in this direction right here, which you can't see from the doorway, the other in this direction right here, and that's always the problem, because as you come in here, you've got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here doesn't get shot in the back
You'll see another person come right up here, and he'll hold on this door, because that's not been cleared space yet, again, straight trigger finger, but ready to shoot if he needs to
You see them having their sectors of fire
Same thing when you come into a building

Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head
Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned and swollen
Definitely put up a fight
These could take out a Jeep or a Humvee in a heartbeat
It's -- yes, it's extremely dangerous, because once you enter these buildings, we found, actually, enemy, you know, guarding these sites
And we have the capability to send pictures or actual video, and then they can make (UNINTELLIGIBLE) if they want to maybe avoid that area or go ahead and go out and engage those folks
Dodging missiles and triple-A fire is something new to this squadron
They've just come across one of the Marine convoys that they need to track, so they're watching every move that the Marines make as they move towards Baghdad, making sure they don't come across any type of threat

When you're on the ground fighting, every piece of information you've got about what you're coming up against is golden
And one more safe Marine is one more Marine that can continue on north to Baghdad
Coming up, we are going to go live to Fort Bliss, where the name of that base is a far cry from the mood there today, after confirmation that more of their own were killed on the battlefield
We'll look at the routes ahead of where our guys are going to go and try to see what enemy is there
An apparent friendly fire incident in northern Iraq is taking more of a toll on Kurdish leaders than we knew at first

More than 40 were injured
The military chief of the Kurdish KDP, the brother of their leader, Massud Barzani (ph), was gravely hurt
The idea was to open the way with heavy sustained American bombing of Iraqi positions
Even as we filmed the wreckage, U.S. jets were still dropping their bombs nearby
Giant explosions erupted down the road
Then, as the Kurds advanced again, the Iraqis opened up
Now we're hearing the boom of Iraqi guns as they fire towards our positions
All morning, the Kurds have been trying to advance, and that was the shell going off
Here in the north, Iraqi tanks and guns are still firing, and the American effort is looking a little ragged
Even as we filmed the wreckage, U.S. jets were still dropping their bombs nearby
They primarily talked about the war in Iraq, the aftermath of Iraq
What was to follow was a horrific education in terror and torture: in the smoking basement of the bombed building, a warren of cells
The hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only, another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture

while we do, we want to tell you marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary groups today
if you are going to fight on the ground, you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way
this is one technique, one possible way u.s. forces might seize a bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis
this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing
artillery behind them firing back
makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side
the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the oncoming forces fire ing at you from being able to see
this would be representing m1-a1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing
for some perspective, let's turn to miles o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd
again, today, there were disturbing hints, and we underscore hints here, that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons
the findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching baghdad since, as the iraqis should know, u.s. and british forces do not use chemical weapons
u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it
there has been intelligence scraps, who knows how accurate they are, chatter in the system, that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place
the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be planning to use chemical weapons
u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u.s. and allied troops cross it
in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counterproductive to saddam, because it would only galvanize international
experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have, hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down
for some americans who find themselves spending hours on end watching television coverage of the war, it can be hard to break away

late word from london that the tabloid the daily mirror just hired peter arnett to be its correspondent in baghdad
we're getting late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not be be kicked out of iraq after all
originally the central command said the veteran fox news correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he's been embedded with
says he's not aware he's being expelled but says if so, it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at msnbc blew the whistle on him
the central command on the other hand says rivera is being kicked out of iraq because "he gave away the big picture stuff
all of this now under review, whether or not geraldo stays or goes
it sounds to me like some rats at my former network, nbc, are spreading some lies about me

Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years, according to an international firearms legislation expert
Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane massacre, were aberrations
His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997

U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable, hair-trigger circumstances
U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Falluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable, hair-trigger circumstances
Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as a scandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city
I would have shot the insurgent too
Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives

Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this story, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives
Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings, and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn't on the minds of the insurgents
For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush

More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead, and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER
But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of the brutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul, Minn, used a Russian-built Saiga 7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle
But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident
While the media use words like "military style," "assault" and "semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle

From the Associated Press : "You go to war with the Army you have," Rumsfeld replied, "not the Army you might want or wish to have
Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can

If you can't charge someone for killing a fetus via abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing

Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which gives a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they've got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible
Of course, I'm sure the Democrats would also like to start winning elections again
The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National, particularly between two leading candidates: former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot rebound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society's most emotional conflicts

Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr, Andrea Yates, by ruling that one of the prosecutor's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial
Yates, in case you have forgotten, is the women from Texas who heinously drowned her five kids, aged 6 months to 7 years, one by one, in her bathtub
No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children
In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children
Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense, most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided money for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils

The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more than one child
As a result, only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys, because couples traditionally favor males

A lone gunman opened fire with an assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in upstate New York, wounding one person before running out of ammunition and being subdued by employees, authorities said

A lone gunman opened fire with an assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in upstate New York, wounding one person before running out of ammunition and being subdued by employees, authorities said
And because New York has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from concealing weapons - a gunner can use bag-toting shoppers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shoppers at his mercy
Had an armed civilian been inside the mall, perhaps he could have intervened before the suspect began injuring people before he ran out of ammo
You're telling me someone was able to take an AK-47 "assault rifle" into a mall and injure people

He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes

The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants
And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn
Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor

Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO
On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians
Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994

During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994
In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat
By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly
This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings
Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades
Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace, give me a effin break

On Sunday he wrote of two Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies when the Mosul bombing occurred
One piece of shrapnel sliced through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two Iraqis
They moved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry
After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health
When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was
No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country
This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq

The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity
The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity
A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity
But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store
It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology
The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas
One is the death of Yasser Arafat
But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader

In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project
She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project
It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read
Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby
Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it
Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby
Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it
Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner
Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide

He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office

In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups
Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis

They don't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly
The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon
Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party
Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities
Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area
Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed
His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived
PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader
It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different

After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out
Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline
This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts
This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body
Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated
One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field
This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass
I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson

If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman

Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc

The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game
That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year

Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison

But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines
And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt
And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith
And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody
Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves
Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action
Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least
While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack
Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate
I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away
In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire
Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals

In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School
Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference
I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world
The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business
I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School
Is there high turnover among senior managers
If the CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous company
But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire
Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG
Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter
I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left
Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status
Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004
The results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy & technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady

You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced
It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job
Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely
So I will thankfully accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy
Both companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees
Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme
