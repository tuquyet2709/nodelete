EVENT : Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time
EVENT : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
EVENT : The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows he wasn't the most stable of people
EVENT : Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war

EVENT : Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured
EVENT : That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it
EVENT : And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state
EVENT : The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage
EVENT : Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress' coffers
EVENT : Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina
EVENT : Can you say that the lawyers, the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic coffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy

EVENT : She died awaiting surgery
EVENT : Does that look like a Lottery winner to you, holding a picture of his dead baby
EVENT : But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you, who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000 for the loss of a child

EVENT : The average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in South Florida
EVENT : If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic costs, economic losses
EVENT : Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience
EVENT : And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
EVENT : It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
EVENT : payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National Practitioners Databank
EVENT : Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
EVENT : President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays

EVENT : It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors
EVENT : If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine
EVENT : Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right
EVENT : Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor
EVENT : Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment
EVENT : Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system
EVENT : But here in Washington, President Bush says it's all a hoax, and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war
EVENT : Congressman Sanders, you're opposed to this war
EVENT : When the guns begin to fire, when the American men and women are in harm's way and may be dying, is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops
EVENT : Well it's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqi women and children are killed, and when young men and women in this country are unnecessarily put at harm's risk, what should we do
EVENT : And obviously we're going to pray that there's fewer casualties
EVENT : Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets

EVENT : No, I don't demonstrate against anybody during a war
EVENT : What I do know is Saddam Hussein has butchered over a million of his own citizens

EVENT : What we're talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war
EVENT : You don't know what happens when the most powerful nation on Earth invades and occupies a Muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people
EVENT : I'm not crazy about it myself
EVENT : No, it's so important -- you know this -- and I know it's fun and we love doing partisan Punch & Judy, but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war
EVENT : For example -- wait a second -- in Iran, the reason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah
EVENT : You who put the Shah in power
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : But I mean you're attacking the CIA for putting him in, when it was -- the problem was Khomeini
EVENT : The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies
EVENT : The same weekend they arrested the guy, we had
EVENT : And I'm curious, how can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught
EVENT : We had no part in it
EVENT : No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan
EVENT : Why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq
EVENT : The question of whether we go to war or not is strictly a national question
EVENT : On this Ash Wednesday, the pope asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for peace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war
EVENT : We don't need war
EVENT : They're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war
EVENT : The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein
EVENT : President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get
EVENT : It doesn't mean we have to go to war
EVENT : But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force
EVENT : It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein
EVENT : Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force
EVENT : I'm saying we don't need to use force right now
EVENT : Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn't
EVENT : Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show
EVENT : Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal
EVENT : A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives
EVENT : You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation
EVENT : You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation

EVENT : Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decided to run for president
EVENT : You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post, being an ambassador or a governor or some thing
EVENT : In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm
EVENT : Later, the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side
EVENT : Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda
EVENT : And how'd they get them
EVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
EVENT : We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King
EVENT : One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : Isn't that wrong in a time of war
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : One of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror of war
EVENT : If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world
EVENT : You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest
EVENT : Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
EVENT : Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're arresting
EVENT : Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people
EVENT : We should do all of those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the
EVENT : They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it's no big deal there
EVENT : And the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world
EVENT : I mean, what happens if India decides that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan
EVENT : I don't think we have to kill to prove that
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I think it's unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil
EVENT : The people are against it
EVENT : Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky and kooky fans and friends and critics right in
EVENT : Don from Denver, Colorado writes, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to Iraq" -- which I do
EVENT : Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes, "France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq
EVENT : But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not
EVENT : I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil
EVENT : Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is because they have democracies
EVENT : He's trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers
EVENT : What does that have to do with the war in Iraq
EVENT : On the other hand, the region is pretty unstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm
EVENT : And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran
EVENT : And my question is, after today's meeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is it old Europe
EVENT : Who sends troops to die on our side
EVENT : We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some
EVENT : So what is it like for them to face combat far from home
EVENT : For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories
EVENT : There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people
EVENT : Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire
EVENT : A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead
EVENT : Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone
EVENT : Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes
EVENT : Duke, what's it like to kill somebody
EVENT : And I went to the priest, because it bothered me
EVENT : I knew I could do it again
EVENT : But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did
EVENT : And it still does
EVENT : War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing
EVENT : it
EVENT : Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam
EVENT : You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are in combat, you will be killed
EVENT : Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way
EVENT : Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety
EVENT : If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion, out of bravery
EVENT : Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud, decorated combat veterans
EVENT : It's just, a decade later, killing still troubles the soul
EVENT : Did you do it again
EVENT : I shot down four more MiGs
EVENT : As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing

EVENT : Well, as coalition forces push north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy
EVENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
EVENT : What stops though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war
EVENT : They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you
EVENT : We know where they're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition
EVENT : The plane arrived back to base safely

EVENT : At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism
EVENT : It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable
EVENT : No injuries reported
EVENT : Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact

EVENT : At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism
EVENT : House clearance Royal Marine style, troops from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) commando task to seek out the last pockets of Iraqi resistance in Umm Qasr go in hard to arrest suspected regime sympathizers and search for weapons
EVENT : The Iraqis arrested looked bemused and plead innocence but with many militia here, pretending to surrender only to open fire on their captors later, first impressions can be deceptive and lethal

EVENT : A man in this vehicle took a pot shot at the commandos
EVENT : It was a painful and bloody mistake
EVENT : We sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and we took about 12 or 13 prisoners, three or four enemy were injured and they've now been flown out and we're treating them including a man who is almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest

EVENT : Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise
EVENT : They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States
EVENT : Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today
EVENT : The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief
EVENT : Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas
EVENT : Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market, if that had been a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated
EVENT : Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in that direction as well
EVENT : Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town of Kalak in northern Iraq
EVENT : He just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling

EVENT : Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak which of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish forces, we've been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been bombing the ridge line behind us
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours

EVENT : Rusty, what sort of crowd is showing up there
EVENT : As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident
EVENT : In trucks and on foot they came to the town of Safwan
EVENT : When we come back, one of the many sad aspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for
EVENT : When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops
EVENT : Hopefully it will be a short war

EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE) population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us
EVENT : Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor
EVENT : Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racing across the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle
EVENT : Just ahead we'll have the latest on today's suicide bombing in Israel
EVENT : It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad

EVENT : There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March 27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack
EVENT : We will be back later on the war in Iraq
EVENT : It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the U.S.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : Dozens, though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to an eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : CNN's Kelly Wallace reports on today's attack in Netanya
EVENT : Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon
EVENT : As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility
EVENT : According to a leaflet from the group obtained by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians with the people of Iraq
EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Many here though say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber

EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the general direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward
EVENT : Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad
EVENT : There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
EVENT : U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process

EVENT : Earlier in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala with a minimum of fight
EVENT : There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack guns
EVENT : The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the direction of the 7th Cavalry
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
EVENT : This as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad
EVENT : The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning
EVENT : The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle
EVENT : Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses in and around Karbala
EVENT : They were then able to advance far north of that city and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad
EVENT : That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the battlefront
EVENT : So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground
EVENT : The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the regime is gone

EVENT : Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
EVENT : At the same time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris River crossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there
EVENT : Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut
EVENT : But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon
EVENT : We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains, or anything like that
EVENT : Additionally, their ability to use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically
EVENT : Clearly, as we threaten the core of the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up
EVENT : In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a several-pronged attack
EVENT : In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a several-pronged attack
EVENT : The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago
EVENT : Could be urban combat
EVENT : They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed
EVENT : They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed
EVENT : Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad
EVENT : Simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy
EVENT : U.S. forces moving ever closer to Baghdad, but military officials say they are not counting on capitulation
EVENT : Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there
EVENT : I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government
EVENT : A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
EVENT : That means stocks were up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of the war in Iraq
EVENT : And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that
EVENT : The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991
EVENT : They rose up, didn't get American support
EVENT : Colonel Patrick Lang, retired, United states Army, thanks for your insights
EVENT : He's retired with the United States Army
EVENT : A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
EVENT : But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
EVENT : There is much fear here of the Saddam loyalists who still hold sway in Basra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates
EVENT : As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
EVENT : We will approach Baghdad
EVENT : The Americans are racing towards Baghdad, the British still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as possible
EVENT : These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
EVENT : And to the south, British forces continue their attack on targets around Basra
EVENT : British troops control the outskirts of the town, and today destroyed another building they said housed Iraqi fighters
EVENT : But there may first be fighting in the capital, 250 miles to the north
EVENT : From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq, coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been called a ferocious bombardment
EVENT : From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq, coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been called a ferocious bombardment

EVENT : Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
EVENT : Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
EVENT : We are now between the lines, a no man's land of abandoned Iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence, broken by the roar of warplanes and the distant surge of air strikes

EVENT : With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war
EVENT : With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war
EVENT : I will be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war is going
EVENT : But, as it has from the beginning, air power remains an important part of the battle
EVENT : In two weeks after the air war began, there is no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis
EVENT : According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
EVENT : According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
EVENT : We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in Iraq
EVENT : It's a base that was taken over by the coalition last week
EVENT : But the are no more Iraqis here, the coalition took over this base last week
EVENT : That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya
EVENT : And when you arrive there, you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein
EVENT : What's happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait
EVENT : There is a lot of fighting in this area
EVENT : After he told us that, we asked him during his missions, and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him
EVENT : Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting SA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground
EVENT : So they're still out there. But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continue to be effective
EVENT : And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort
EVENT : We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties into Iraq
EVENT : What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there to refuel, to stage operations further north
EVENT : With the power out now in Baghdad, we're getting word that loudspeakers have been blaring in the Iraqi capital, urging citizens to go to the international airport there, presumably to defend it against coalition forces
EVENT : Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport
EVENT : Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport
EVENT : In the final push to Baghdad, U.S. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops
EVENT : And the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city's southern limits
EVENT : But the Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand
EVENT : Farther south in Basra, smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today
EVENT : And in northern Iraq, Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with U.S. military commanders
EVENT : The forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city
EVENT : Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert
EVENT : At daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River
EVENT : At daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River
EVENT : These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from Baghdad
EVENT : We don't think that the fighting is over yet, and so there are still options available to the regime, including the use of weapons of mass destruction
EVENT : The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican Guard
EVENT : The Medina division, which is one of the toughest outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength
EVENT : Others are down to 50 percent, but there's still one or two divisions around 75, 80, 90 percent of their fighting strength, and they could still put up very stiff resistance, indeed, when the American forces get en masse to Baghdad itself

EVENT : Her parents said they don't know yet what caused their daughter's injuries
EVENT : Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone
EVENT : They have no idea at this time what caused them
EVENT : And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk a little bit about urban combat
EVENT : Gravity rules, even in urban combat
EVENT : Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
EVENT : And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think of that Blackhawk down scenario, Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here
EVENT : If we move in on Baghdad, and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat
EVENT : Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
EVENT : And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone
EVENT : President Bush vows a final push to victory and he mourns the loss of fallen Marines
EVENT : We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics
EVENT : It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
EVENT : It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
EVENT : That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will
EVENT : And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone
EVENT : And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone

EVENT : LaDouce says e-mails were dispatched to Indonesian officials, but he doesn't know what happened to the information
EVENT : Thousands could die
EVENT : On the other hand, if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving people from tsunamis, you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event
EVENT : You can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time
EVENT : We just learned that our friend's daughter when to Thailand to visit her father after the wave hit

EVENT : Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother's wedding this weekend because they are not LDS
EVENT : Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
EVENT : I got a sort of an icky feeling when I realized the only people who did attend the kid's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father, who suffers from Alzheimers
EVENT : The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide
EVENT : There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whose bishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town, so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well
EVENT : He insisted that he needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that she really needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was not LDS
EVENT : Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage didn't last
EVENT : I can't help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making our marriage a gospel focused one
EVENT : For my part though, I think we started the marriage with a compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price
EVENT : I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple
EVENT : I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple
EVENT : Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
EVENT : I really think it's time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often in a more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing
EVENT : I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely
EVENT : Hmm... I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony, and went on later to be happily sealed
EVENT : I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of state
EVENT : Perhaps my exwife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now
EVENT : I think divorce is really stupid
EVENT : Divorce really sucks
EVENT : She wrote an article about a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. B being happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group

EVENT : Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally
EVENT : Either its bad or good

EVENT : Oh, yeah, it wasn't perfect
EVENT : I was one of the first digital camera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage
EVENT : They say it takes one year for every two that you were married
EVENT : Especially for those of us who still have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I've still got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have
EVENT : We're going to a bed and breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax
EVENT : If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together, maybe even getting married
EVENT : My mother took his remarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that
EVENT : I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even though I really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride
EVENT : Dell is involved in a class action suit for "bait and switch", where a nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items, and for promising "easy credit" for which no one qualifies and then charges ridiculously high interest rates
EVENT : All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone
EVENT : The cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy
EVENT : the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits
EVENT : i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit
EVENT : It seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line
EVENT : The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : Doing the right thing provides no protection from class action
EVENT : i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit
EVENT : i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit
EVENT : Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago
EVENT : So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers
EVENT : Since companies are going to be sued in class action, regardless of the merits of the case, the threat of a class action is not a detriment
EVENT : If you don't believe that, witness the Vioxx lawsuits
EVENT : Because of that, it is being sued
EVENT : They are not being sued
EVENT : The Red Cross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administratice costs
EVENT : Just give carefully. if you are going to give assistance then LOOK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $$$
EVENT : I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami
EVENT : Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity
EVENT : I've heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their donations, with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses
EVENT : It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donations earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will go directly toward aid
EVENT : So that is the channel we chose for our own donation
EVENT : 9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds
EVENT : Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by millions of dollars per hour
EVENT : Although the need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort
EVENT : This is why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in South Asia
EVENT : They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now
EVENT : So they didn't discourage donations to them per se, just not for this specific area
EVENT : Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children
EVENT : Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children
EVENT : The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you're below .05
EVENT : In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys, which supposedly landed in his lap
EVENT : Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside, keys in my pocket, but I've decided I'll take the train home later
EVENT : The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he wasn't on a public road when the cop arrested him
EVENT : I'm reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub
EVENT : I'm in charge of getting everyone excited about contacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them
EVENT : Remember to stress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group (whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that she will be there because she wants to learn about that group's concerns and issues at A&M
EVENT : If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact me at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send the info to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time
EVENT : Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice

EVENT : I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently exited executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment reasons
EVENT : I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth

EVENT : Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still remember though the pain I felt
EVENT : I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool (not available round here
EVENT : If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool
EVENT : So don't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful
EVENT : If you don't have an institutional water birth available, have you considered just staying home
EVENT : I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful
EVENT : My girlfriend was on the run from probation in Fla when she got herself in trouble here in Az
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : 2 "FTA"s (failure to appear), one in FL and one in AZ, plus whatever the original charges were in both cases
EVENT : All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask, and the AZ jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation
EVENT : They let her serve her time in AZ, then they come and get her to serve her time in FL
EVENT : It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another
EVENT : Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA
EVENT : But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether
EVENT : But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether
EVENT : She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time
EVENT : She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time
EVENT : Az in trouble in 2001, fla is mentioned and she signs another waiver of extradition, posts bonds and skips (not far enough apparantly
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : I think they want to give her 3 years
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her
EVENT : The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her

EVENT : On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy
EVENT : Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home
EVENT : At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : He was cited for simple assault and battery
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment
EVENT : A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital
EVENT : So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
EVENT : Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am
EVENT : So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
EVENT : A nurse said, "He beat two of us up
EVENT : I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that
EVENT : I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone
EVENT : The cops are here because we're pressing charges
EVENT : He was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : By the time he got to our home, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me "he's crazy and just walked out
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : He was cited for simple assault and battery

EVENT : Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big enough to get some serious attention
EVENT : the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
EVENT : Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different
EVENT : I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life
EVENT : Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts
EVENT : That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors
EVENT : If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
EVENT : My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004
EVENT : If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005
EVENT : the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
EVENT : I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004
EVENT : If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005
EVENT : S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter
EVENT : You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares
EVENT : A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee
EVENT : If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
EVENT : A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s
EVENT : BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill
EVENT : I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill
EVENT : I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK
EVENT : BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill
EVENT : I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill
EVENT : I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK
EVENT : He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time
EVENT : You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until yesterday
EVENT : The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed, and still they could not catch him
EVENT : The rich hire private security for a reason--public security is often inadequate
EVENT : What's the deal with parole
EVENT : Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time
EVENT : Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary
EVENT : If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law

EVENT : You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind
EVENT : You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again
EVENT : And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again
EVENT : So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
EVENT : So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
EVENT : As for how long it lasts, I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence, but I'm not sure about that
EVENT : It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts
EVENT : You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
EVENT : Also, you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess
EVENT : For some reason, I can't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a jury trial or what
EVENT : You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
EVENT : The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the governor's election is Washington State because there were some "errors" in the process
EVENT : So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent
EVENT : In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but also "perfect
EVENT : Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution, the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes
EVENT : The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the governor's election is Washington State because there were some "errors" in the process

EVENT : In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out
EVENT : The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable
EVENT : If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a success by any measure," that's good enough for me
EVENT : You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq
EVENT : Of course, the Republicans would have thought the WA State election *was* perfect, had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared
EVENT : Everyone, everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government
EVENT : Think about this objectively (forget the US is involved), if a foreign country invaded another and set up elections, wouldn't a reasonable person question the validity of the election results

EVENT : Say it's 1942, and the German occupiers in Holland have set up elections with Dutch candidates
EVENT : The next election will be the one with more legitimacy
EVENT : Even if you, John H, believe the US held impartial elections in Iraq, don't you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid, or least suspect
EVENT : Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles
EVENT : Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero
EVENT : Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
EVENT : Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
EVENT : Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000
EVENT : Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away
EVENT : Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day
EVENT : Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day
EVENT : It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
EVENT : To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &Camaratta's departures
EVENT : He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over before resigning
EVENT : John McCrary resigned from the board as a result
EVENT : It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open
EVENT : At scholastic tournaments, no cash prizes are paid
EVENT : However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately
EVENT : However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately
EVENT : For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF, the accountant was immediately fired
EVENT : To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &Camaratta's departures
EVENT : When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome
EVENT : It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
EVENT : We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville
EVENT : Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere
EVENT : Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened -- not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had a stockpile of WMDs
EVENT : Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade
EVENT : Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade
EVENT : And Bremer decided to destroy the existing Iraqi army, leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order
EVENT : He was not given very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals too

EVENT : US breaking news of terrorist attack in near future
EVENT : sounds like some heavy war rhetoric to me
EVENT : I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us being the US's powers that be)..."The Iranian nation is not looking for war, violence and confrontation," Khatami said
EVENT : I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us being the US's powers that be)..."The Iranian nation is not looking for war, violence and confrontation," Khatami said
EVENT : so you believe him when he says that iran isn't looking for it, but you don't believe the US when we say that we aren't
EVENT : but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran
EVENT : that is the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti-war people wanted for iraq
EVENT : The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate
EVENT : There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that
EVENT : Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist
EVENT : The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved
EVENT : Swenson herself would also leave the NCA
EVENT : Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal
EVENT : In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded
EVENT : The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate

EVENT : Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles
EVENT : Drive back to Boston passing through New York
EVENT : Fly back to Austin
EVENT : Plus while driving back north to Boston we can spend the day in NYC
EVENT : You might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank, or as soon as you arrive in New York, if the drop off charges aren't too much
EVENT : The main reason I'd like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls is mainly because it's so close
EVENT : The main reason I'd like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls is mainly because it's so close

EVENT : To put it simply (for your benefit): Lincoln spoke *of* God, demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities (their religious beliefs among them) than differences
EVENT : and he has made the point repeatedly in interview after interview that he has never claimed to speak for god, nor has he claimed that this is "god's war
EVENT : When is an election not an election
EVENT : When is an election not an election

EVENT : The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20% of the population
EVENT : If so, should that affect the legitimacy of the election
EVENT : A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
EVENT : The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops
EVENT : The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy
EVENT : But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will
EVENT : These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement
EVENT : If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis
EVENT : Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain
EVENT : In addition, they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not restricted their election related activities
EVENT : The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they didn't vote
EVENT : It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote
EVENT : If anyone has a right to call the elections "illegitimate" it would be the shi'ites
EVENT : A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
EVENT : Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote
EVENT : They faced, however, no pressure from the rest of the country, nor from the "occupying" forces to stay away from the vote
EVENT : You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day
EVENT : If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding
EVENT : America invasion, occupation Iraqis are unprovoked
EVENT : Who do you think the insurgents were killing -- shi'ites
EVENT : Again, America has LPDR under its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground units from Laos
EVENT : Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connection to China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations
EVENT : Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number of Arabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty of Hmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming Sino-US war
EVENT : Read between the lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then there will be no bloodshed in Laos
EVENT : Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate, the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China
EVENT : These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to be the fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the Miao Rebellions
EVENT : This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight for their own country
EVENT : now, you are expert of preemptive strike...LOL
EVENT : and the hmong sits and watch from the sideline while KIM II and BUSH jr. kill each other...Now wouldn;t that be a scene to view
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : Some Hmong Americans may be reintroduced to Laos
EVENT : Saddam posed a threat to Saudia, Kuwait, and the British oil protectorates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded, stupid
EVENT : The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars
EVENT : Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility
EVENT : Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility
EVENT : Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran
EVENT : Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers
EVENT : How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
EVENT : Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran
EVENT : Anyone remember Khomeini's declaration in 1982 that Iran wouldn't stop fighting until they overthrew Saddam
EVENT : How about Saddam's use of chemical weapons
EVENT : Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers
EVENT : How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
EVENT : Saddam was so unimpressed by Iraqi casualties, he invaded Kuwait barely two years after the UN-imposed ceasefire
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
EVENT : To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them
EVENT : In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US
EVENT : she must seize them, if others refused to sell them
EVENT : In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US
EVENT : I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years
EVENT : To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war
EVENT : To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war
EVENT : I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front
EVENT : I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front

EVENT : The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
EVENT : The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
EVENT : One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future
EVENT : Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US
EVENT : This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US
EVENT : However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort
EVENT : Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed
EVENT : Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed

EVENT : However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936
EVENT : It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
EVENT : The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel
EVENT : Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry
EVENT : This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war
EVENT : The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it
EVENT : While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control
EVENT : For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China
EVENT : To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal
EVENT : Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler
EVENT : An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies
EVENT : Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years

EVENT : confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College
EVENT : The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all
EVENT : This would have delayed secession and the Civil War
EVENT : Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate, wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40% of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow
EVENT : Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote
EVENT : WI it was only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas? I believe Douglas would have won

EVENT : You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC
EVENT : I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps
EVENT : As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000
EVENT : The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't
EVENT : Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
EVENT : This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for
EVENT : It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live, surely
EVENT : I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive
EVENT : The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices
EVENT : The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state
EVENT : Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
EVENT : Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails
EVENT : Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just trying to get it into perspective
EVENT : I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small
EVENT : Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable

EVENT : Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to Holocaust Day
EVENT : I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future
EVENT : Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails
EVENT : Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable

EVENT : Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized
EVENT : But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like human rights violations going on all around the world
EVENT : Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch, you know

EVENT : I c- but, now, I don't know that I would vote for a death penalty because I'm not sure that a -- a death cancels out a death

EVENT : In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison
EVENT : In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison

EVENT : I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I didn't watch the trial at all
EVENT : I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I didn't watch the trial at all
EVENT : I read about it in the newspaper and things like that
EVENT : I know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it
EVENT : I- I think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
EVENT : In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
EVENT : Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I don't really know very well
EVENT : Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel
EVENT : And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership role
EVENT : We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know, doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country
EVENT : Other topics -- you know, usually about the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um, to say
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening, a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the United States that make it
EVENT : Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent
EVENT : They had those retreats and things with the leaders
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : I think that, um,  his death -- marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace
EVENT : I think that now he's gone, his family is still around, and
EVENT : but it wasn't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to ((send)) the Israelis out of Jerusalem in the areas that they wanted
EVENT : If you know the Bible well you would know that there's always going to be a conflict there
EVENT : I'd like to -- I know that,  you know, there's been problems, a lot of conflict over there, and it seems like no matter what
EVENT : And I agree that we shouldn't send people over there
EVENT : just like Iraq ye- eh, we try to go in and get peace and- and how long has it been and,  I mean, I think Saddam needed to be removed but it's- -- there's just -- s- all these people that are going to follow him no matter what
EVENT : I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : I don't think that we should get involved to a level, a point where we're sending people over there and, um, trying to -- help keep the peace or anything like that,  um
EVENT : I was more,  um,  kind of a -- I was a kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that wasn't a,  you know, one of my topics of interest at the time, it is now
EVENT : Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, study international affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit about him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time, longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace with the Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or)) divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war and terrorists in the area
EVENT : It's a matter of, uh -- I mean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um, hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um, they don't like each other
EVENT : I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the conflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh- For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for Israel and another one for Palestine
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh, became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President Bush time
EVENT : For example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval
EVENT : For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement
EVENT : I think,  the people,  uh,  the people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess
EVENT : But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
EVENT : Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : Criminal Trials
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial
EVENT : Why do you think this trial has been so publicized
EVENT : What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention, and why
EVENT : What's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall
EVENT : Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial
EVENT : And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison
EVENT : But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
EVENT : And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
EVENT : And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
EVENT : So he didn't get both first degree murders
EVENT : And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
EVENT : And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
EVENT : And actually I don't even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two
EVENT : And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think, and this last election showed that both are very brutal
EVENT : Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year- old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated in
EVENT : Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you
EVENT : It was a very brutal election
EVENT : and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that I'm really not really I don't like their policies
EVENT : And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was my thinking
EVENT : Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
EVENT : Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
EVENT : In fact, we just got back from Disney World,  you know, about an hour ago and they're down there and they're but they're both, uh
EVENT : and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : Um, man I thought I, uh,  put this whole election stuff behind me
EVENT : And, um, elections wore me down
EVENT : Yeah, I- in fact, I thought we already had a discussion on this, uh, about elections some time back, but I guess it was -- question was framed differently, I guess
EVENT : and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates
EVENT : And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him
EVENT : And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way
EVENT : Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could
EVENT : But do you think, um -- that -- and this isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to be another attack on the ~US
EVENT : You know, it's been going on for all these many -- what
EVENT : I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time
EVENT : hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
EVENT : hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
EVENT : It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him, I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now
EVENT : It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned
EVENT : Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send over some very -- low level state department person
EVENT : But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think, uh,  I can understand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or it it should be a change for the ~PLO
EVENT : He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements
EVENT : You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know
EVENT : And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to, you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, you know
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know
EVENT : They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore
EVENT : And it's and it's it's you know,  a war of attrition
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
EVENT : Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
EVENT : He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
EVENT : He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
EVENT : Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it was poisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it
EVENT : Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when they when -- basically the state of Israel was formed
EVENT : Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there were Jewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish people started going there and they j- basically just- you know, they just took over
EVENT : There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts
EVENT : So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways, a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the Israelis
EVENT : But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've been kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in terms of his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of years uh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something
EVENT : And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle
EVENT : And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle

EVENT : You know, you're sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know
EVENT : Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone through they come home and they have nothing
EVENT : Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone through they come home and they have nothing
EVENT : he didn't get his papers where he's going to be c- -- he's in upstate New York right now but he's going to -- have to probably go back to- to either Iraq or Af- Afghanistan
EVENT : I- I didn't know they could send them more than once
EVENT : Eh, he quit, or he resigned
EVENT : That's why his father didn't want to invade Iraq, because of all these problems they're having now
EVENT : Look at what happened a couple days ago, they killed, um,  like seventy people
EVENT : I don't know why- how he got elected, I mean, there's a lot of people that did vote
EVENT : Well, but, I mean, you know, I don't see what he's doing, I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : Well, but, I mean, you know, I don't see what he's doing, I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : has resigned
EVENT : War in Iraq
EVENT : The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
EVENT : Much of the country is unstable, but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January
EVENT : Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what
EVENT : Well, I have a nephew, he just got back from Iraq
EVENT : He was in the army and he's going to probably be going to Afghanistan he told me
EVENT : Well, yeah, and and they named another one and he resigned
EVENT : Well, yeah, and and they named another one and he resigned
EVENT : Eh, he quit, or he resigned
EVENT : Yeah, it's all -- you know, I I I don't know if we're doing the right thing because now look at Iran, what are we going to be, uh,  and he he's talking about trying to invade Iran now
EVENT : Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the war in Iraq, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the elections that are going on
EVENT : Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the war in Iraq, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the elections that are going on
EVENT : War in Iraq
EVENT : Do you support the -- do you- do you support the war
EVENT : Do you support the war
EVENT : Yeah, I did at first I just- I just -- I -- don't like the way it was managed
EVENT : Yeah, I- I mean, I- I did support the war
EVENT : The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
EVENT : Do you think the elections are going to happen
EVENT : Much of the country is unstable, but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January
EVENT : do you think the elections are going to happen
EVENT : And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this
EVENT : And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this
EVENT : I just talked to somebody from ~LA a couple days ago about that on the -- survey line
EVENT : Yeah, I think the -- I think they're still they're going to go through even though, uh, even though,  um, what's it called,  that you know of all the -- turmoil that's happening there and all of the argu- you know, and all the -- killings and everything
EVENT : They kept on scheduling them and they we're saying, oh, no no no, you know
EVENT : Um,  yeah, I think -- you know I think they should have continued to go through with it, and you know um -- if- if there is -- if there's problems, you know, just -- still -- don't, you know -- just ignore it, keep going, you know you can't -- stop, you know,if you already started something, you know, you should complete it, I think
EVENT : I know they set up the council,  uh, interim council, but that hasn't gone,  you know, perfe- smoothly
EVENT : So, if they can just sort of make a -- be- get into more of a supportive role and,  you know, flex their muscles when they need to and maybe that will help- help,  uh,  squall some of the vi- the violence
EVENT : I don't know if that could, uh,  if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just that- that -- a lot of that's, you know,  uh, weapons and terrorists have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from Syria
EVENT : Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what
NEVENT : The Congress gave him authority, but the American people disagreed with the decision
NEVENT : Not according to the polls
NEVENT : Not the polls that I have seen
NEVENT : Congressman Hayworth, back to a comment
NEVENT : And I know that you meant it and I agreed with it
NEVENT : This is Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad
NEVENT : I'm curious, would that have accurately described him in 1988
NEVENT : Oh, yes. I think it does
NEVENT : I think it has described him, especially since he's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979
NEVENT : I agree
NEVENT : Therefore, wasn't Dick Cheney, as the CEO of Halliburton, wrong to be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988
NEVENT : I don't know about any oil equipment going to Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : What I do know in the here and now is
NEVENT : I can tell you about it if you like
NEVENT : That's fine
NEVENT : And I know you'd love to cloud the issue
NEVENT : That's an important issue to me
NEVENT : Dissent is fine, but these cheap shots, I don't know anything about Halliburton.
NEVENT : He had $73 million worth of to sell oilfield equipment to Saddam Hussei
NEVENT : And to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute, but we are dealing with a clear and present danger
NEVENT : Would you have treated him as a customer, the way Dick Cheney did
NEVENT : I don't even know about that
NEVENT : Would you have sold oilfield equipment to him
NEVENT : Yes. Hello
NEVENT : Iran had hostages
NEVENT : Seventy-nine Americans were held hostage
NEVENT : Hello
NEVENT : We're talking
NEVENT : The United States of America
NEVENT : Oh the evil United States
NEVENT : But the point is
NEVENT : I want to get to that point
NEVENT : I can't quite figure that out
NEVENT : Everybody knows that
NEVENT : The CIA did that
NEVENT : No, the point I made, Khomeini came about because we put a brutal dictator, the Shah of Iran, in power
NEVENT : The point that I am making is you cannot
NEVENT : The point you're making is blame America first\
NEVENT : No I'm not
NEVENT : That's what you're doing
NEVENT : You're talking about blowback
NEVENT : We know what happens
NEVENT : Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, thank you very much
NEVENT : Congressman J.D. Hayworth, a Republican from Arizona, thank you both very much
NEVENT : We will come back to this debate, believe me
NEVENT : One of our viewers, though, thinks there's a sure fire way to get that al Qaeda ring leader to talk
NEVENT : We'll let him fire back in a little bit
NEVENT : But next, out of all of the pictures from this weekend's nail biter between J.D. Hayworth's alma mater of state, and
NEVENT : Bob Novak's beloved University of Maryland, only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the CROSSFIRE Picture of the Day
NEVENT : You do not want to miss this
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Christa Demore from Monrovia, Maryland
NEVENT : And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time
NEVENT : Doesn't it show that
NEVENT : He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time
NEVENT : So I'm still doubtful of no, here's why
NEVENT : This is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer
NEVENT : We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies
NEVENT : We're not severing it question
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Ben Charlton from East Lansing, Michigan
NEVENT : I was if we wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty
NEVENT : Well, where are all of the conservative questions
NEVENT : We never have conservatives in the audience
NEVENT : There's no question
NEVENT : I think even Paul would agree with me
NEVENT : It's not a United Nations question
NEVENT : That is correct
NEVENT : The president has got all of the legal authorities he needs
NEVENT : I just pray to god he doesn't use it
NEVENT : We need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves
NEVENT : But legally he has no obligation to go back to the U.N
NEVENT : From the left I am Paul Begala
NEVENT : Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Robert Novak
NEVENT : Join us next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Hello, everybody
NEVENT : Welcome to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : We will debate all of that as well as Vanity Fair's latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson
NEVENT : Believe it or not, we got new news on Michael Jackson
NEVENT : Do you think he really looks like a mummy
NEVENT : Certainly not a daddy
NEVENT : But first, our own little moonwalk across the political landscape, the CROSSFIRE Political Alert
NEVENT : The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council
NEVENT : President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said quote I used to have one of their pigs
NEVENT : So OK, I made that up
NEVENT : He didn't say that
NEVENT : Well, I suspected that
NEVENT : You know
NEVENT : But they are a swing vote
NEVENT : Guinea is an important swing vote
NEVENT : As is Cameroon
NEVENT : France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying, Look, they're working
NEVENT : I think that's a good point
NEVENT : Well, France and Germany would like to
NEVENT : Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament quote too little, too late gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction
NEVENT : U.S. intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have
NEVENT : Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad
NEVENT : In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm quote here and now
NEVENT : So, there you have it
NEVENT : who do you believe
NEVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell or France
NEVENT : No, the question is
NEVENT : That is the question
NEVENT : Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes
NEVENT : We are watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a hoax
NEVENT : But Paul
NEVENT : They are disarming
NEVENT : No, no, no that's not what the president's saying
NEVENT : He's saying, the it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there
NEVENT : Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until recently, said he didn't even have
NEVENT : He's a liar
NEVENT : Of course
NEVENT : And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him foolish task,don't you think
NEVENT : Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein.
NEVENT : The question is, Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women
NEVENT : That's a separate question
NEVENT : That's a very separate question
NEVENT : I think he's not
NEVENT : I think the inspections can work
NEVENT : That's a different argument
NEVENT : We can take it up later
NEVENT : So there it is, according to NBC
NEVENT : In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show
NEVENT : NBC, of course, is a division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right wing things to life
NEVENT : I actually like Phil Donahue
NEVENT : I've interviewed him a number of times
NEVENT : His arguments are really dumb
NEVENT : I don't know if you've listened to Phil Donahue
NEVENT : Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts you excluded, of course, and James
NEVENT : But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very well
NEVENT : Have you noticed that
NEVENT : He had the highest-rated show on the network
NEVENT : Which is saying what
NEVENT : They're good to me
NEVENT : They're very nice people and they're very good to me
NEVENT : OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC
NEVENT : Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced she'll be making some changes
NEVENT : Not to her ideas, which are few
NEVENT : Not to her record, which is pretty embarrassing
NEVENT : Not even to her staff, which is, of course, tiny
NEVENT : But to her name
NEVENT : From here on out, Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun
NEVENT : Did you catch the difference
NEVENT : In the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names
NEVENT : Moseley Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation
NEVENT : They'll have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit
NEVENT : That would be, of course, the honorable Al Sharpton
NEVENT : Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham
NEVENT : Beating them
NEVENT : And Al Sharpton didn't even have to change his name
NEVENT : How did he become honorable
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : By embodying the values of your party
NEVENT : Your values, not mine
NEVENT : He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black primary voters
NEVENT : I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate
NEVENT : We haven't even begun the primaries
NEVENT : He's not a serious candidate
NEVENT : He's right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen
NEVENT : Not right wing
NEVENT : Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight
NEVENT : Then, can you spell prosthetic nose
NEVENT : Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new Vanity Fair profile of Michael Jackson
NEVENT : We'll talk to her
NEVENT : You won't want to miss that
NEVENT : We'll be right back
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : France, Russia and Germany today restated their opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten Saddam Hussein's grip on power
NEVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
NEVENT : Mr.King, thanks for stying with us through the break
NEVENT : And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests
NEVENT : So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations
NEVENT : The important thing is that the bill pass for the military
NEVENT : If the other stuff's in there, it's there
NEVENT : I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military
NEVENT : I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point
NEVENT : On the other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to them
NEVENT : So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that's what we should do
NEVENT : A lot of Democrats said similar things
NEVENT : This weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and another significant al Qaeda member were captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan
NEVENT : Doesn't it turn out that Mr.Daschle and others didn't know what they were talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that in public when they don't know what they were talking about
NEVENT : You would agree with that, wouldn't you
NEVENT : Why was he No. 3
NEVENT : Why wasn't he No. 4
NEVENT : Well, I don't know
NEVENT : I think that puts you pretty high up in the organization
NEVENT : I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was
NEVENT : I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figures in al Qaeda
NEVENT : Have you
NEVENT : But I think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, we should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : A defenseless nation
NEVENT : They have biological weapons
NEVENT : How are they defenseless
NEVENT : Listen, if this is
NEVENT : It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons
NEVENT : Come on
NEVENT : Let me tell you
NEVENT : We have a lot of people
NEVENT : that have dangerous weapons
NEVENT : What happens if the North Koreans take another look
NEVENT : Our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we're right
NEVENT : I'm sorry to have to do this, but we are out of time
NEVENT : I want have Congressman Peter King from New York back on, and Congressman Charlie Rangel
NEVENT : Thank you both for a very interesting debate
NEVENT : In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's efforts to be a peacemaker
NEVENT : Later, the author of Vanity Fair's scary new look at the King of Pop, Michael Jackson
NEVENT : You will not want to miss this
NEVENT : Stay with us
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael Jackson, he's kooky, wacky
NEVENT : I recall, as reported in 'The Wall Street Journal,' that the transactions were legal
NEVENT : Is it possible that the equipment allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by the U.N.
NEVENT : They were legal because Mr.Cheney's company used a loophole
NEVENT : They went through a foreign subsidiary
NEVENT : But they did enrich Saddam Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral
NEVENT : They were wrong
NEVENT : Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : I would agree with that
NEVENT : It means Cheney is a hypocrite
NEVENT : Well it's a complete
NEVENT : That's great
NEVENT : Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain
NEVENT : Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do with Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : It must be the humanitarian reasons
NEVENT : Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume
NEVENT : It is a weird assumption, don't you think
NEVENT : As you know, I've never said that
NEVENT : You haven't
NEVENT : It's called democracy
NEVENT : Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people
NEVENT : They hate America, Paul
NEVENT : My name is Christina Wright
NEVENT : I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota
NEVENT : It might
NEVENT : I mean that's absolutely one of the fears
NEVENT : That it would destabilize the entire region
NEVENT : So the question is, could it be worse
NEVENT : Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region
NEVENT : Maybe he's right
NEVENT : I don't think he's thought it through
NEVENT : I think it's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problem
NEVENT : Oh, come on
NEVENT : That's silly
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany
NEVENT : It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on the side of the United States. So France and Germany that's actually true find themselves in the minority on their own continent
NEVENT : And good
NEVENT : Only Great Britain is with us
NEVENT : The only country
NEVENT : What do you mean only Great Britain
NEVENT : My question is not who votes at the U.N.
NEVENT : Nobody except Great Britain
NEVENT : We are isolated
NEVENT : From the left, I am Paul Begala
NEVENT : Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Tucker Carlson
NEVENT : Join us again tomorrow night for yet more CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Their military service goes back to the Vietnam era
NEVENT : Others, though, are novices
NEVENT : They are, we are told, well trained
NEVENT : This is a messy business
NEVENT : In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days
NEVENT : And what's that like
NEVENT : That's one of those introspective times where it's just it's just an introspective time, not a public time
NEVENT : After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back
NEVENT : And one of the guys looked at me and says
NEVENT : And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me
NEVENT : You don't think about those things
NEVENT : And it's removed
NEVENT : It's far off
NEVENT : It's not in close
NEVENT : Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict
NEVENT : It's not something that civilized people do
NEVENT : You don't it's just not it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstance
NEVENT : Training bridges that gap
NEVENT : So your choices are not varied
NEVENT : It's very simple
NEVENT : And so you do what you're trained to do
NEVENT : You do what you're there to do
NEVENT : And, in Vietnam, it was body count
NEVENT : It's hard to explain what training can do
NEVENT : Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training
NEVENT : You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way
NEVENT : I should be going the other way
NEVENT : He won a Bronze Star
NEVENT : Nobody is looking for medals
NEVENT : Everyone wants to live another day
NEVENT : Don't misunderstand
NEVENT : Maybe that's a good thing
NEVENT : Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington
NEVENT : Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are going through right now in Iraq, they will remember for the rest of their lives
NEVENT : That's our coverage this hour
NEVENT : Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi aircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery
NEVENT : Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq
NEVENT : No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane I'm thinking the same way
NEVENT : The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's going wrong
NEVENT : As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do
NEVENT : Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S. combat helicopters
NEVENT : Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling
NEVENT : Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper
NEVENT : Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land
NEVENT : At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer
NEVENT : Looking with the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see
NEVENT : The pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes
NEVENT : Again, we know where we're going
NEVENT : We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down
NEVENT : We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down
NEVENT : But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason
NEVENT : They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions
NEVENT : I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment
NEVENT : No rescues were necessary on this sortie
NEVENT : Do you have any fear
NEVENT : Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this circumstance
NEVENT : This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours
NEVENT : This is a very busy base
NEVENT : We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings
NEVENT : It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it's been like for the past 11 days
NEVENT : We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign
NEVENT : Wolf, back to you
NEVENT : Gary Tuchman in an air base near the Iraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman
NEVENT : General Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition
NEVENT : That's at noon Eastern, nine A.M
NEVENT : Pacific tomorrow
NEVENT : That's Sunday and I'll be back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports
NEVENT : We'll have a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments
NEVENT : In the meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington
NEVENT : We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for late edition on Sunday
NEVENT : Thanks Wolf
NEVENT : Greg Milam is with the U.K. forces in southern Iraq
NEVENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
NEVENT : This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil, even 120 mil
NEVENT : So there's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used
NEVENT : Do you know when this place was last used
NEVENT : I mean do you know
NEVENT : I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them
NEVENT : Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking
NEVENT : The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them
NEVENT : Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot
NEVENT : The rest is carried way out into the desert
NEVENT : With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them
NEVENT : With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions
NEVENT : With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do
NEVENT : No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks
NEVENT : Greg Milam, Sky News, Southern Iraq
NEVENT : That's something to look at
NEVENT : CNN's Chris Plante is chasing all that down for us at the Pentagon right now
NEVENT : Hello Chris
NEVENT : Hi, Judy
NEVENT : That's right
NEVENT : So it won't change our overall rules of engagement
NEVENT : It doesn't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care
NEVENT : So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles
NEVENT : Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures
NEVENT : The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia
NEVENT : The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target
NEVENT : If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads
NEVENT : They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed
NEVENT : Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability
NEVENT : Well, no major concern
NEVENT : The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : We're paying attention to all those details for us, Chris Plante at the Pentagon
NEVENT : Coming up, coalition forces control several parts of southern Iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance
NEVENT : That story when we come back
NEVENT : A serious problem they still face though, pockets of resistance
NEVENT : Reporter David Bowden is with the British forces in Umm Qasr in southern Iraq
NEVENT : It's not pretty and there's no please and thank you but for the Marines, every door potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line, manners go out the window
NEVENT : This patrol did find hidden weapons
NEVENT : They're not the first and they're unlikely to be the last
NEVENT : The Marines believe they have a firm hold on Umm Qasr right now but they can't afford to slack in their grip and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup and begin again their cycle of violence
NEVENT : The Marines with their snipers have now snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include the town of Umm Kiou
NEVENT : As in Umm Qasr before it, they're here to clear out the opponents to regime change
NEVENT : It was a painful and bloody mistake
NEVENT : We've now evacuated them out and the enemy now have either fled or they've been captured
NEVENT : The Royal Marines are satisfied they are in control of this small corner of Iraq
NEVENT : Their task now is to keep it that way. David Bowden in southern Iraq
NEVENT : That report filed just a short time ago
NEVENT : Well, CNN analyst Ken Pollack who is with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution is with me now
NEVENT : He is an expert on the Iraqi military and its tactics and weapons
NEVENT : Right
NEVENT : I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. and British forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops
NEVENT : They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're adapting
NEVENT : They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face
NEVENT : The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line, risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting
NEVENT : They're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that
NEVENT : You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines, get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield
NEVENT : So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with
NEVENT : Absolutely
NEVENT : One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S
NEVENT : forces are
NEVENT : Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top
NEVENT : It doesn't come from the ground up
NEVENT : You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work
NEVENT : Tell everybody else to do the same thing
NEVENT : Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down
NEVENT : There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it
NEVENT : I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people
NEVENT : I just interviewed a gentleman, native of Iraq, who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders
NEVENT : They hate Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : They don't like what he's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991
NEVENT : The U.S. didn't finish Saddam then
NEVENT : President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind
NEVENT : Which raises questions going forward
NEVENT : What's the significance of that
NEVENT : Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the
NEVENT : Chances are it was an Iraqi surface to air missile
NEVENT : We're going to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman
NEVENT : There's been some action in that area
NEVENT : Nick - I mean - I'm sorry
NEVENT : Ben, we can make you out just barely but tell us what you've been seeing
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : Not just Iraqi positions behind us, in addition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which is a major northern Iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me
NEVENT : Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after the
NEVENT : They have mortars
NEVENT : They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south
NEVENT : Ben, very - we thank you very much for that and we'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on
NEVENT : We're getting close to the bottom of the hour
NEVENT : We're going to get some headlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins
NEVENT : I hope they get a little rest
NEVENT : Slowly humanitarian aid is rolling into southern Iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate the need is
NEVENT : Correspondent Martin Geissler files this report from the Iraqi town of Safwan
NEVENT : Now they are desperate
NEVENT : Within seconds the Kuwaiti aid workers who had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob
NEVENT : These desperate scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid
NEVENT : This is survival of the fittest
NEVENT : Only the healthy and strong can get to the food
NEVENT : The weak and the ill are left with nothing
NEVENT : Despite this effort to help the Iraqi people, resentment is never far away
NEVENT : We hate U.S. We hate British, England
NEVENT : What do you think about Saddam's regime
NEVENT : Saddam's very good man
NEVENT : As the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to uglyf
NEVENT : We, as a consequence, have had to move out
NEVENT : It's simply too dangerous
NEVENT : This is a clear indication that despite the coalition reassurances that this part of Iraq is safe and despite the aid being brought into the people here, it is still a very, very volatile area
NEVENT : Tonight here the strong are eating
NEVENT : The weak still go hungry
NEVENT : Martin Geissler, ITV News, Safwan southern Iraq
NEVENT : So many different pictures we are getting from across that country
NEVENT : Well, they are making their voices heard at home and abroad
NEVENT : Congresswoman Maxine Waters was among those scheduled to attend
NEVENT : CNN's Rusty Dornin is with us from San Francisco
NEVENT : I'm getting various estimates on the crowd
NEVENT : We did want to show you an interesting thing here
NEVENT : Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here
NEVENT : You're looking at some of San Francisco's police department's officers
NEVENT : I did ask them why they did that
NEVENT : They said they were wearing skullcaps so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity
NEVENT : They said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that's all right or not
NEVENT : So far, very peaceful
NEVENT : As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an Iraqi American
NEVENT : He's with the Iraqi American Council
NEVENT : How do you feel about supporting the troops
NEVENT : ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
NEVENT : They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
NEVENT : But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
NEVENT : U.S
NEVENT : commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
NEVENT : How does the Iraqi American Council feel
NEVENT : Well the Iraqi American have been waiting for this liberation and they want to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it's been offered to us
NEVENT : He would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab world and the European country
NEVENT : Now you said you did talk to your family in Baghdad as well and they also are somewhat suspicious of the Americans
NEVENT : Well, I mean the Iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole thing
NEVENT : Yeah my family, you know, still in fear
NEVENT : You know they stay in one room
NEVENT : They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street
NEVENT : I mean yes, you know, my prayer to them but we can only do so much
NEVENT : We can live in liberty and freedom soon
NEVENT : Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war protesters
NEVENT : Have you had anyone either threatening you or
NEVENT : No, no problem
NEVENT : OK
NEVENT : Thank you very much
NEVENT : Thank you
NEVENT : It is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedience acts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next week
NEVENT : The situation here appears to be increasingly tense
NEVENT : A few moments ago, out on the horizon, not very far ahead of the U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, we heard more than a few explosions
NEVENT : The U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days
NEVENT : It was the Army which assigned me to the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and that was extremely fortuitous
NEVENT : It was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces, because this is a crack unit
NEVENT : It's the tip of the tip of the spear
NEVENT : We just heard an incoming what the hell
NEVENT : No, no, I don't know what it is
NEVENT : Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed
NEVENT : What you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting
NEVENT : We're hearing incoming
NEVENT : We're not sure what it is
NEVENT : We see some stuff in the sky
NEVENT : We may have to break this off
NEVENT : I think we're going to break off this live shot for the time being
NEVENT : We're not sure what we see up there
NEVENT : Goodbye
NEVENT : We've got to dive for vehicles, we think
NEVENT : See you
NEVENT : Bye
NEVENT : We'd like to now show you what we call Old Betsy, a re-used, secondhand U.S. Army Humvee that we've been traveling with
NEVENT : Any bullet will pass through it, even a .22 caliber bullet
NEVENT : You can see our body armor draped on the door
NEVENT : This is what we've literally been living in
NEVENT : This is the kitchen, when we're down, and we're very fortunate, because we've got a teapot
NEVENT : That's my cubby hole
NEVENT : It's extraordinary cramped, because sandbag the floor, in case we hit a mine
NEVENT : That's all the space I have to eat and sleep in
NEVENT : You don't sleep
NEVENT : You really don't sleep out here
NEVENT : You have to realize, they've been riding along, bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now
NEVENT : And if you ride inside that tank, it is like riding in the bowels of a dragon
NEVENT : They roar, they screech
NEVENT : The hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort
NEVENT : We cannot tell you the levels of personal discomfort we've experienced
NEVENT : The extraordinary sandstorms, the bitter cold nights
NEVENT : The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin
NEVENT : That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist
NEVENT : Let me give you an example of what the dust like
NEVENT : Look at this
NEVENT : We have been through days of dust like that
NEVENT : Actually, they're very close, that is to say, no more than 40 yards away, but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you're getting these vague images
NEVENT : It's like being in a blizzard, except unfortunately, the sand doesn't melt as the snow does
NEVENT : What we eat is what the Army calls MREs, meals ready to eat
NEVENT : And I must say, they're pretty darn good
NEVENT : And of course, everybody fights for the best ones
NEVENT : The treats are things like the M&amp;Ms and the breakfast toasties
NEVENT : Let me hold the camera and show you my crew
NEVENT : On camera left is Charlie Miller, he's been our superb and intrepid cameraman
NEVENT : On my right is Jeff Barweis, a brilliant satellite engineer
NEVENT : That's the crew which really brings you these pictures
NEVENT : The pictures you're seeing are absolutely phenomenal
NEVENT : These are live pictures of the 7th Cavalry racing across the desert
NEVENT : You've never seen battlefield pictures like these before
NEVENT : A report from CNN's Kelly Wallace when we return
NEVENT : Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end
NEVENT : And it did on this day
NEVENT : We can show you some pictures from earlier Sunday
NEVENT : People here tell us the cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather
NEVENT : And many soldier
NEVENT : Two soldiers were down here
NEVENT : Many blood
NEVENT : Many people skip from here
NEVENT : Big paranoia
NEVENT : I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN, reporting from Netanyahu, Israel
NEVENT : A baseball legend rallies the troops
NEVENT : Up next, pitching great Roger Clemens talks about his experiences meeting U.S. service members in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf
NEVENT : Hi, Judy
NEVENT : Thank you very much
NEVENT : As of an hour or so ago, we got word from the battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of Baghdad
NEVENT : And they may be even closer right now
NEVENT : The Pentagon says two of the Republican Guard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces
NEVENT : Scenes from Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit
NEVENT : Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs
NEVENT : Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad
NEVENT : And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division secured the town of Karbala
NEVENT : Yesterday we were about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad
NEVENT : We have perhaps have that distance
NEVENT : Walter Rodgers, CNN, with the U.S. 7th Cavalry in the Iraqi desert
NEVENT : And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just miles from the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital
NEVENT : Here's his report just filed a few minutes ago
NEVENT : In fact, it's going much faster than many of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted
NEVENT : The armor, and mechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are moving at rapid speeds
NEVENT : Let's get an update now on casualties on Operation Iraqi Freedom
NEVENT : U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner
NEVENT : One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue of Private First Class Jessica Lynch
NEVENT : That's all coming up on our special edition of WOLF BLITZER REPORTS at the top of the hour
NEVENT : Judy, back to you
NEVENT : All right, Wolf, and we will be watching
NEVENT : Thanks very much
NEVENT : Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
NEVENT : Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now
NEVENT : Hello, again, Jamie
NEVENT : Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile
NEVENT : First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf
NEVENT : They met lighter than expected resistance
NEVENT : They may just suddenly be effective on the ground
NEVENT : We believe they have the capability now
NEVENT : At the U.S. Central Command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, General Vincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approach Baghdad
NEVENT : Is there a chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the strength of what's left of the opposition
NEVENT : Well, they might be
NEVENT : And that might be a good thing
NEVENT : They are taking it very cautiously
NEVENT : No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead
NEVENT : Could involve chemical weapons
NEVENT : Could be a very dangerous time
NEVENT : We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact, they said let others do that
NEVENT : Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon
NEVENT : For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta
NEVENT : Thank you very much, Judy
NEVENT : To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang
NEVENT : He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things
NEVENT : Colonel, good to have you with us
NEVENT : What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance
NEVENT : Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines
NEVENT : Or both
NEVENT : You're welcome
NEVENT : Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition
NEVENT : So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past
NEVENT : Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is
NEVENT : Well, let me ask you that
NEVENT : First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery
NEVENT : This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad
NEVENT : Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there
NEVENT : We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles
NEVENT : One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport
NEVENT : Do you suppose that is a key target right now
NEVENT : Oh, I'm sure it is
NEVENT : I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold
NEVENT : And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well
NEVENT : Control of these highways will be crucial won't it
NEVENT : Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches
NEVENT : They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain
NEVENT : It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts
NEVENT : Some have said Chicago is a good analogy
NEVENT : Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong
NEVENT : Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet
NEVENT : If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force
NEVENT : If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements
NEVENT : Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that
NEVENT : They rose up, didn't get American support
NEVENT : Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad
NEVENT : Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out
NEVENT : Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious
NEVENT : They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq
NEVENT : And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far
NEVENT : So they'll wait and see what happens
NEVENT : It's the other people in the city you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime
NEVENT : And their behavior right now is unpredictable
NEVENT : Always helps Miles to hear a voice of experience
NEVENT : Thank you and thanks to Colonel Lang
NEVENT : When we come back, hopes rising among investors
NEVENT : We're going to check in with Rhonda Schaffler at the stock exchange in just a moment
NEVENT : As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
NEVENT : But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
NEVENT : ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
NEVENT : These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
NEVENT : They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
NEVENT : But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
NEVENT : U.S. commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
NEVENT : We will approach Baghdad
NEVENT : The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is gone
NEVENT : To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra
NEVENT : Tim Ewart, ITV News, southern Iraq
NEVENT : CNN's Brent Sadler is there
NEVENT : A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oil wealth
NEVENT : A road that's now in the hands of Iraqi Kurdish forces
NEVENT : Occupying these positions, strattled along a crescent-shaped front line east of Kirkuk
NEVENT : This is the end of the road for Kurdish forces manning this remote checkpoint
NEVENT : But with special permission, they let us through
NEVENT : This territory is within easy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk
NEVENT : The oil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, a harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable
NEVENT : Iraq's precious oil field remain intact
NEVENT : Also intact, Kirkuk's defenses, in the distant haze
NEVENT : Iraq's armed opposition, including these Kurds, waits on the sidelines to join the fray, if America asks
NEVENT : This is about freedom for Iraq
NEVENT : This is about the liberation of Iraq, and we Iraqis must shoulder the responsibility of helping in the process of liberation
NEVENT : Brent Sadler, CNN, near Kirkuk in northern Iraq
NEVENT : Let's check in with CNN's Gary Tuchman at an air base near Iraq
NEVENT : Gary you've seen it firsthand from the first moments
NEVENT : Well, that's right, Judy
NEVENT : We come to you from a base near the Iraqi border
NEVENT : They also fly F-16s
NEVENT : There are also Marine FA-18s and Marine Heriers at this base
NEVENT : And we spent part of the day at that base
NEVENT : This is Talil, Iraq
NEVENT : The Talil Air Base
NEVENT : It's now a major staging point
NEVENT : You know you are in Iraq when you drive down the road coming into the base and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : You can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1, 2003
NEVENT : Want to give you a look
NEVENT : There's a lot of security personnel here
NEVENT : You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles
NEVENT : These are Air Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance
NEVENT : We're near the town of Nasiriya
NEVENT : But this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition
NEVENT : A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that Iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on Saddam Hussein's sash
NEVENT : And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50 percent
NEVENT : Lieutenant Colonel Webb is telling us he has a mission this very evening
NEVENT : A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties
NEVENT : Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions
NEVENT : Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are
NEVENT : Here at this particular base they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready to Eat
NEVENT : They come in a bag
NEVENT : And when you get an MRE you get your meal and you get a little treat with it
NEVENT : What a lot of people here at this base do, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy called Charms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms
NEVENT : They consider it a good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat them
NEVENT : So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy
NEVENT : Back to you
NEVENT : Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions
NEVENT : Gary, one another quick question for you
NEVENT : Are you able to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it
NEVENT : They also fly these HH-60 helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground
NEVENT : They stage there and refuel
NEVENT : But right now, none of them are permanently based there, although the plan is for that to eventually happen
NEVENT : All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms
NEVENT : You saw him holding it
NEVENT : Could Tony Blair be in line for a gold medal
NEVENT : Tales of how some in Congress want to honor the British prime minister
NEVENT : Thanks very much, Judy
NEVENT : British forces say they're consolidating their position in Basra's key suburbs
NEVENT : They reportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : Reporter Carl Dinnon of Britain's ITN filed this report
NEVENT : Wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests there has been some Iraqi opposition
NEVENT : Meanwhile, coalition commanders posted American special forces were now operating at will
NEVENT : It seems to have been abandoned, but the United States said it was still on the trail of Saddam and his closest circle
NEVENT : We remain cautiously optimistic
NEVENT : We take that very seriously
NEVENT : We take it in a sober fashion
NEVENT : And at the same time, we remain prepared to continue operations
NEVENT : That means it's practically inoperative
NEVENT : The noose appears to be tightening on Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : The question is, how desperate he will get before he is finally toppled
NEVENT : Carl Dinnon, ITV News, Iraq
NEVENT : In the southern city of Najaf, home to one of Islam's holiest sites, moments of tension that could have gone either way earlier today
NEVENT : Angry locals who did not understand their intentions clearly showed their intentions as well
NEVENT : CNN's Ryan Chilcote is in Najaf
NEVENT : We're going to get to him shortly
NEVENT : But Judy Woodruff, back in Washington, has breaking news Judy
NEVENT : Wolf, we're going to break in here, because the parents of Jessica Lynch, who live in Palestine, West Virginia, are before the microphones, I'm told, just about to talk with reporters
NEVENT : They're walking toward the press
NEVENT : Let's listen
NEVENT : Good afternoon
NEVENT : We appreciate y'all coming out for what you're doing for Jessie and all of the other troops that are missing
NEVENT : We've been waiting all day word from the doctors, and they have successively done one surgery on her
NEVENT : There will be other surgeries to do that
NEVENT : It's going to take time and patience
NEVENT : But she's great and she's doing good
NEVENT : She's in real good spirits
NEVENT : We talked to her
NEVENT : We talked to her before the surgery, we talked to her after the surgery, and she's doing good
NEVENT : Can't you think
NEVENT : Yes, a bunch, but my mind's blank
NEVENT : The doctor has completed one surgery on her back
NEVENT : They have released the pressure on a nerve, and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it, and that was because she didn't have any feeling in her feet
NEVENT : So he, he's pretty sure right now that that will relieve, relieve the tension, and her feet will be able to move
NEVENT : The doctor has not seen any of this
NEVENT : They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs
NEVENT : And we are just waiting to get that good news too
NEVENT : We talked to her before and after the surgery, like I said, and she's just, she just sounded real good
NEVENT : Of course, this morning she was a little groggy
NEVENT : But yet, she was good, because it was early
NEVENT : And then this afternoon, after the surgery, she was our Jessie again
NEVENT : We know she's in good spirits, because they told her they was gonna put pink casts on her legs and arms, and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she her mind is working good
NEVENT : So she's in good spirits, and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow, just as well as it did today
NEVENT : You said she was in good spirits
NEVENT : Can you describe your conversation
NEVENT : I teased her again about the Army jeeps and she said, I know where there's a bunch of that we can find
NEVENT : So, we know she's in good spirits
NEVENT : She was asking for a hairbrush
NEVENT : Gregory Lynch, the father of Jessica Lynch, and Jessica's mother talking to reporters, saying they have talked to her today, both before and after surgery, that she says she's feeling good
NEVENT : They say she will be good
NEVENT : But they said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinal cord or spinal column
NEVENT : He said to relieve some pressure on a nerve
NEVENT : They were concerned because she didn't have feeling in her feet
NEVENT : Thanks very much, Judy
NEVENT : This is not probably a comparable situation, is it
NEVENT : Not in any way
NEVENT : And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad, and we will use them
NEVENT : Those tanks have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them
NEVENT : The Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns
NEVENT : That's a lot of mobile protective gunfire
NEVENT : Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles
NEVENT : And we also are not going to use similar tactics there
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : We want to show you an animation, and share with our viewers, maybe you can point out a few things about this
NEVENT : What we've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here, right over here is a mosque
NEVENT : We depict that to show that's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf
NEVENT : As we get a little bit closer here, in a typical scenario like this, you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this, and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that
NEVENT : What we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in
NEVENT : How much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city
NEVENT : It's a great question
NEVENT : I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that is why movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous
NEVENT : We'll use patience and finesse
NEVENT : We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in
NEVENT : We'd like to resume with that animation if we could
NEVENT : That's Saddam International Airport
NEVENT : That's another segment
NEVENT : Can we get back to the animation
NEVENT : And I'd like to just finish this out
NEVENT : Here we go
NEVENT : Ad we move it along, you'll see eventually the troops will come marching in
NEVENT : In this case, slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door
NEVENT : Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of last resort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the top of the building down
NEVENT : One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill
NEVENT : So, you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase
NEVENT : Interesting, all right
NEVENT : Thank you very much for your time
NEVENT : We appreciate it Judy
NEVENT : Thank you, Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard
NEVENT : Meantime, the U.S. reportedly has hundreds of troops poised to reinforce the Baghdad international airport, now under the control of American troops
NEVENT : A source tells CNN's Nic Robertson, some Iraqi Republican Guard forces are gathering close to the airport
NEVENT : Columns of coalition forces keep pressing north and tightening the noose on Baghdad
NEVENT : CNN's Central Command says some 2,500 Republican Guard forces surrendered, that is, between Kut and Baghdad
NEVENT : While coalition forces say they have secured the facility, that's not the case in the surrounding area
NEVENT : It was a showpiece of his regime
NEVENT : Now Saddam International Airport is controlled by coalition troops and, tonight, it has a new name, Baghdad International
NEVENT : A passenger jet burned out on the tarmac
NEVENT : Wreckage burning in a hangar as U.S. troops rush in
NEVENT : Building by building, they swept the terminal complex, then moved on to secure the runway
NEVENT : The fall of his airport is a humiliating blow for Saddam
NEVENT : Hopefully, this is a sign that we're able to send to the residents of Baghdad that we're here and they can rise up and deal with the regime appropriately
NEVENT : Here, the remains of an Iraqi armored car, and by its side the body of an Iraqi soldier, all that remains of a column that pushed up the airport road last night in a final effort to defend the airport
NEVENT : U.S. troops are now knocking on the door of Baghdad
NEVENT : The patchy, somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night has left coalition commanders with several questions
NEVENT : James Mates, ITV News, with the U.S. marines, south of Baghdad
NEVENT : Iraqis pulled back on the road to Mosul as CNN's Jane Arraf reports from the battlefield
NEVENT : It's a bridge over the river on the main road to Mosul
NEVENT : The Peshmerga are just down the road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on to the bridge
NEVENT : Are you coming here
NEVENT : In this vehicle, the only Iraqi casualties we saw
NEVENT : Their military radio and guns indicating they were combatants
NEVENT : It's still smoldering, this truck with three Iraqi soldiers
NEVENT : These were lying on the ground next to the truck
NEVENT : Somebody picked them up
NEVENT : It's an I.D. card, presumably for one of the soldiers
NEVENT : The only thing you can really tell from it is that he was 27 years old
NEVENT : And a snapshot from when his life was still ahead of him
NEVENT : Other evidence of a hurried retreat amid the smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask
NEVENT : Military documents
NEVENT : Notebooks with verses from the Koran
NEVENT : The village of Manguba, just 32 kilometers, about 23 miles from Mosul is now in Kurdish hands
NEVENT : One Kurdish soldier did the honors of tearing up a poster of Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : Not just the poster, but the frame and cardboard backing as well
NEVENT : They've been waiting a long time
NEVENT : Jane Arraf, CNN, on the bridge over the Khoser River in northern Iraq
NEVENT : Thanks very much
NEVENT : Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters, our embedded journalists
NEVENT : We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of WOLF BLITZER REPORTS
NEVENT : Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you
NEVENT : Thanks, Wolf
NEVENT : And we'll be watching
NEVENT : Michael Kelly, of course, with Atlantic Monthly, and a columnist for the Washington Post
NEVENT : And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher
NEVENT : Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action
NEVENT : His story is especially poignant
NEVENT : His father is a navy commander
NEVENT : We're going to ask our military analyst
NEVENT : That's coming up
NEVENT : Dominating the city gates to Basra
NEVENT : Saddam Hussein and his henchmen still claim to control this southern port
NEVENT : But the British want to send a powerful symbolic message
NEVENT : Soldiers are here to tear down the regime and all it stands for
NEVENT : The approach can seem frustratingly slow, but day by day, the Desert Rats are exerting more control
NEVENT : Checkpoints meant to filter out Iraqi hardliners
NEVENT : Drastic action is need to convince a dubious population
NEVENT : Get down, get down
NEVENT : These are men singled out by locals and believed by army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption
NEVENT : Most are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the state-sponsored climate of fear
NEVENT : The party's influence extends to every corner of Iraqi society
NEVENT : In two small communities, we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up
NEVENT : Some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead, uncertain of their fate, overcome by nerves
NEVENT : But as it ended, there was no British apology for the scale of the operation
NEVENT : We came in firm, we came in fair
NEVENT : We gave a good warning before we came in
NEVENT : This is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated, or the British risk being accused of installing their own rule of terror
NEVENT : Despite the discomfort of a few, there's a conviction that this is a night's work that will benefit the majority
NEVENT : Juliet Bremner in Basra
NEVENT : Well, there has been a terrible discovery by some other British troops in southern Iraq
NEVENT : At its daily briefing, U.S. Central Command says Operation Iraqi Freedom is far from finished in Baghdad, even though U.S
NEVENT : forces are inside the Iraqi capital
NEVENT : At the Pentagon, Barbara Starr reports officials say today begins a new strategy in the skies over Baghdad
NEVENT : Now the operating plan includes both ground and air missions
NEVENT : The Palestine Hotel is where much of the international press corps is based
NEVENT : Hello again, Miles
NEVENT : Hello again, Judy
NEVENT : You know, just those two words together, I think, scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong
NEVENT : You know, I'm impressed, looking at this map, it almost looks like a chess game, kind of sterile
NEVENT : That is couldn't be further from the truth, could it
NEVENT : Absolutely not
NEVENT : This is very clean and it's very orderly
NEVENT : Suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there, you'll see just how conflicted an environment that is
NEVENT : And all happening so quickly
NEVENT : Let's roll some tape
NEVENT : Just there, I mean, just getting the door out of the way, you can see where the weapons have to go
NEVENT : Now, you just see this soldier right here, he's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile
NEVENT : And he's got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here
NEVENT : Now, he's going to go that direction, because that room is clear
NEVENT : Go ahead and stop the tape
NEVENT : So
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : Now, what about this, this armor
NEVENT : Tell us how they're equipped with armor there
NEVENT : Level 4 armor, this is not just for frag
NEVENT : This will also stop bullets
NEVENT : And there's a difference
NEVENT : The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades, et cetera
NEVENT : This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : Let's roll tape and continue on here and talk about
NEVENT : Now, I notice his hand his sidearm is attached to him
NEVENT : That's for
NEVENT : Exactly
NEVENT : So he goes down the hallway, and you can see once that's called clear, straight trigger finger, in case there's any sympathetic muscle tightening, there's no problem
NEVENT : Sort of ready but not quite
NEVENT : Absolutely
NEVENT : Immediately making entry with the thing, and then pying the room out, getting angles of vision as they clear it
NEVENT : But look at that, a dark space from a lighted space
NEVENT : Who knows what's in the recesses
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : Let's roll that second tape quickly, and we'll show you a
NEVENT : couple more tips from Kelly's perspective
NEVENT : So far, what we're seeing is pretty much textbook
NEVENT : ery different circumstance
NEVENT : But stop the tape right here
NEVENT : Oop, we missed it, we missed it
NEVENT : No, just roll it
NEVENT : Just go ahead and roll it
NEVENT : All of that has to be accounted for as well, not just the space in here
NEVENT : Your back is not covered
NEVENT : Many angles you've got to watch for
NEVENT : Now, you see right here, he's got a sidearm, he's calling the team in
NEVENT : All the rear is Now, stop the tape
NEVENT : Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here
NEVENT : I mean, you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here
NEVENT : Up in this area here, here
NEVENT : No, he wouldn't have that
NEVENT : But let me ask you this
NEVENT : Also that the garb, there's a cultural issue here
NEVENT : That provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be, righ
NEVENT : Absolutely
NEVENT : And someones might say, Well, why put their hands on their head like this
NEVENT : Because, you know, you the hands hurt
NEVENT : And I won't be able to determine what you're doing with your face
NEVENT : Where are your hands and what do they hold
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : Let's roll it real quickly and we'll make a few more points, if we could
NEVENT : A lot of fear in their faces here
NEVENT : You see, by the way, they all have radios, I notice they have, like, a little headset there
NEVENT : That allows them to communicate
NEVENT : Immediate communications, absolutely
NEVENT : All these areas up in here, you know, could be subjected to people hiding, et cetera
NEVENT : Now you've got people coming down that have already been cleared
NEVENT : Look at the fear on the faces
NEVENT : They don't understand what's going on
NEVENT : And you want to keep them calm, and
NEVENT : Very calm, reassure them that this isn't about them
NEVENT : Now, here's a little bit more aggressive stance
NEVENT : Exactly
NEVENT : Go ahead and stop tape
NEVENT : Stop it right there
NEVENT : Oh, we missed it again
NEVENT : Obviously, that person is doing something that that
NEVENT : I would say aggressive is a good word for that
NEVENT : All right, Kelly McCann, thank you for some insights
NEVENT : And that compound that by a city of 5 million, it kind of boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head for U.S
NEVENT : and coalition forces
NEVENT : Thanks very much for your insights
NEVENT : Thanks, Miles and Kelly
NEVENT : I've always wondered what happened who covers the last man or woman in one of those operations, but that's something for your next conversation
NEVENT : Thanks very much
NEVENT : An investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue in southern Iraq after a gruesome discovery by some British troops
NEVENT : Tim Ewart of ITN News reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned Iraqi military base
NEVENT : It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it
NEVENT : The remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board coffins
NEVENT : British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi military base on the outskirts of Azubayr
NEVENT : The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities
NEVENT : The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken, and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform
NEVENT : The coffins were there
NEVENT : It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside
NEVENT : Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead
NEVENT : Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose- built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets
NEVENT : Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead
NEVENT : Forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when
NEVENT : Today's discovery seems to provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime
NEVENT : Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here
NEVENT : But when they do, British soldiers believe, more horrors will come to light
NEVENT : Tim Ewart, ITV News, Azubayr
NEVENT : Well, from a gruesome finding to a dangerous one in central Iraq
NEVENT : U.S. troops work to clear that area of Iraqi weapons, coming up
NEVENT : We've been hearing about the situation in northern and southern Iraq
NEVENT : Now to central Iraq, where coalition forces say they are now in charge
NEVENT : And they are coming across some major munitions finds
NEVENT : The caches were apparently abandoned by retreating Iraqi forces
NEVENT : One such cache turned up in the city of Karbala, a strategic military point about 60 miles to the south of Baghdad
NEVENT : CNN's Ryan Chilcote is embedded with the 101st Airborne Division, and he has the story
NEVENT : Can you show us what you've been finding today
NEVENT : Roger
NEVENT : Well, this is about the third cache we've found today
NEVENT : We've been finding them nonstop, and it's a really tedious affair
NEVENT : I've got an assortment of weapons right here, ranging from AK-47s, to over here, behind them, you'll see mortar sights, 60-millimeter and 81
NEVENT : Off on the far left, you'll see a second-generation starscope, kind of outdated, but still works
NEVENT : If you keep shifting over, you'll see stabilizer fins for mortar rounds
NEVENT : On the back here, you'll see both 60- and 82-millimeter mortars
NEVENT : These are well equipped
NEVENT : Well, they're very well equipped
NEVENT : Rocket-propelled grenades
NEVENT : Been finding a lot of these lately
NEVENT : Now, is this a you said you'd seen a lot of weapons caches recently found
NEVENT : Is this a large cache
NEVENT : No, I'd say this is about a medium cache
NEVENT : This looks like a lot of weapons
NEVENT : It looks like a lot of weapons, but it's really not
NEVENT : This technically, this would probably would outfit a platoon, a platoon of
NEVENT : Keep going on
NEVENT : This is a little bit more advanced, these are 25-millimeter shells, and each one of those silver boxes you see behind them hold 50 of these shells
NEVENT : That's a little bit above us
NEVENT : That's actually going into mechanized and armor
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : And you were talking about the makers, where some of these weapons are coming from, and you were expressing surprise to me
NEVENT : A majority of these are coming from on this box, but Jordan and France
NEVENT : We have a very scattered, limited, and Russian equipment, but like I said, France and Jordan are the main suppliers right here
NEVENT : Now for your guys, this is dangerous work, finding
NEVENT : Don't know if they're going to be booby trapped
NEVENT : Don't know what what's going to be there
NEVENT : So it's very tedious, it's got to be careful about it
NEVENT : Well, we've heard a whole lot about Iraq's use of human shields in defending key sites
NEVENT : Coalition fighters, though, use a different kind of shield
NEVENT : In a CNN exclusive, CNN's Kyra Phillips offers us a ride-along over the city of Baghdad with some airborne bodyguards
NEVENT : We won't consider the mission a success unless the Marines are happy with the product
NEVENT : They are coalition bodyguards over Baghdad, an airborne shield to U.S. Marines
NEVENT : Let them know what's coming
NEVENT : Let them know if anything is coming back behind them on their franks to close off the supply lines
NEVENT : You're now airborne over Iraq with Commander Steve Kroto's Gray Knights, the Navy's P-3 eyes in the sky
NEVENT : Any kind of forces that look like they may be threatening the Marines, you know, we want to let them know
NEVENT : However, protecting forces on the ground isn't
NEVENT : These men are about three hours into their mission, and the sun is starting to set
NEVENT : We're getting closer to it
NEVENT : Also on this mission, Marine Colonel Jim Lukeman and Sergeant Emilio Hernandez
NEVENT : They are tracking and talking to their fellow Marines on the ground
NEVENT : Two vehicles move across the bridge
NEVENT : I'm looking for enemy positions out to the front
NEVENT : Lukeman is warning his troops about a bridge ahead
NEVENT : He doesn't like what he sees
NEVENT : The Gray Knights fly closer and grab a clearer picture
NEVENT : There's some vehicular traffic, so that we know the bridge is still intact
NEVENT : They may be Iraqi military
NEVENT : So now that the Marine division on the ground has that information, they'll take that action they'll take action tactically on it
NEVENT : These flights can last up to 15 hours, but it's the minutes of realtime intelligence that completes the mission
NEVENT : Commander Steve Kroto brings his crew home after locating enemy positions and surface-to-surface missiles
NEVENT : It keeps the Marines safe
NEVENT : Flying over Iraq, Kyra Phillips, CNN
NEVENT : And there are late reports that the 45 wounded include the brother and a son of a Kurdish political leader
NEVENT : Julian Manyon of ITN has more from Northern Iraq
NEVENT : Trying to organize a northern front with just a few hundred U.S
NEVENT : Special Forces troops and the poorly armed Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be a high-risk exercise
NEVENT : But today, it all went disastrously wrong
NEVENT : Earlier, we had joined another convoy of U.S. Special Forces troops and Kurdish fighters as they tried to move south through country abandoned by the Iraqi army
NEVENT : At first, all was calm
NEVENT : American troops controlled the operation from a rooftop
NEVENT : The Iraqi gunners rapidly found our range, and we took refuge in an abandoned farm house
NEVENT : Get down
NEVENT : We finally managed to get out by car
NEVENT : Julian Manyon, ITV News, on the northern front
NEVENT : Julian Manyon with some very dramatic pictures as we look at the live pictures of Baghdad at night
NEVENT : We will take a short break, our live coverage continues
NEVENT : You just heard John reporting about it
NEVENT : It has been said that Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist
NEVENT : I guess you can say in the past tense
NEVENT : His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to support those claims
NEVENT : The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basra is just one example
NEVENT : ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and he takes us on a tour of Basra's chamber of horrors
NEVENT : Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a state of terror, and this is where it's planned and perpetrated, the headquarters of his secret police, this one in Basra
NEVENT : No British soldier has been here yet
NEVENT : Today, as I walked in, I met Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly
NEVENT : Yes, of course
NEVENT : Any people who Saddam did not like
NEVENT : Of course
NEVENT : Of course
NEVENT : The building is crumbling
NEVENT : Down we went, further to cells that had no light, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask and bottles of chemicals
NEVENT : You can imagine this every day, every month
NEVENT : He was one of the prisoners here
NEVENT : For how long
NEVENT : Eight years
NEVENT : Eight, nine, eight years
NEVENT : And his crime for eight years in jail
NEVENT : He prayed too much and was seen as a dangerous radical
NEVENT : More cells
NEVENT : But the Mukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal
NEVENT : And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many days
NEVENT : So desperate are they to tell their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and friends have suffered
NEVENT : And it happened here to tens of thousands of Iraqis that Saddam's secret police deemed dangerous
NEVENT : This man cowered for months, crammed with 300 mothers into a huge cell
NEVENT : This man was here, too, with his brother
NEVENT : There's a prisoner under the name of Ahmed Adis Aeid
NEVENT : They kept records of prisoners, these and their fingerprints all that's left of them, apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they had done
NEVENT : If there is an evil center to Saddam Hussein's regime, then it is surely here and in other places of torture
NEVENT : And there's plenty here that we simply cannot show you
NEVENT : In this block, it was men over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here
NEVENT : To call all this a chamber of horrors is a cliche
NEVENT : And this place is beyond cliche
NEVENT : On the ground, I found a book called The Psychology of Interrogation, as if the men who worked here for Saddam needed a handbook
NEVENT : I was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave, glad I could
NEVENT : Bill Neely, ITV News, Basra
NEVENT : Unspeakable
NEVENT : Our Jeff Greenfield examines that question when we come back
NEVENT : Some thoughts now on the dangers from our senior analyst, Jeff Greenfield
NEVENT : Sean Flynn, son of the famous actor Errol Flynn, disappeared in Cambodia in 1970
NEVENT : Their safety, their lives, may depend on those troops
NEVENT : Not likely
NEVENT : And that raises a bigger question
NEVENT : In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine, CBS News President Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion quote It's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard
NEVENT : This story is going to be told from a U.S. point of view
NEVENT : We are American reporters, the ones with the troops
NEVENT : But whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or South Africa or Iraq, respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side
NEVENT : Jeff Greenfield, CNN, New York
NEVENT : That's tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, 6:00 Pacific
NEVENT : When we return, our Richard Quest takes a look
NEVENT : Stay with us
NEVENT : The students are getting inspiration from their teacher, who has a personal connection, as CNN's Daryn Kagan reports
NEVENT : The mission of these units is to protect these ports
NEVENT : Each one starts the same way
NEVENT : Dear brave friend
NEVENT : Dear brave friend
NEVENT : Dear brave friend
NEVENT : Hello
NEVENT : My name is Ryan
NEVENT : I am in second grade
NEVENT : You are keeping the United States of America safe
NEVENT : You are
NEVENT : You are my best friend
NEVENT : You can keep this in your bag
NEVENT : Sincerely, Ryan
NEVENT : I'm the big brother
NEVENT : It turns out this is actually a story about a brother, Lieutenant Commander Mike Roberts, and a supportive sister, Christine Cupolo
NEVENT : Yes, I do
NEVENT : My brother is in Kuwait
NEVENT : My sister is a grammar school teacher in Clayton, North Carolina
NEVENT : And this is one of many deployments he's been on, but this one is probably the most crucial
NEVENT : So, I knew that, at one point or another, my children needed to write
NEVENT : I thought that would be a real uplifting experience for the troops
NEVENT : And she says: Dear brave friend
NEVENT : Hello
NEVENT : My name is Amanda
NEVENT : We would have to say that you are a very brave person
NEVENT : Just keep it going
NEVENT : Back in North Carolina, the Riverwood Elementary second-graders are working on the next batch
NEVENT : Absolutely
NEVENT : So you want to know how fast the dolphins there are swimming
NEVENT : OK
NEVENT : I would write that down
NEVENT : I would say: Dear, friend, I have some questions for you
NEVENT : I want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out over there
NEVENT : Can you do that
NEVENT : Do you think you could ask them a question
NEVENT : Sure
NEVENT : They will be happy to answer it
NEVENT : But I think this helps me stay closer to my brother
NEVENT : Any message to your sister
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : I'd just like to tell her, thank you very much, Christine
NEVENT : Hope you're doing well in North Carolina
NEVENT : Their second-grade work keeping watch over those who keep watch in the Persian Gulf
NEVENT : Daryn Kagan, CNN, Kuwait
NEVENT : That's it for this hour
NEVENT : I'm Judy Woodruff in Washington
NEVENT : CNN's John Irvine has this profile of a city literally teetering on a razor's edge
NEVENT : Getting acquainted, very deliberately, the U.S. Marines are trying to strike up a rapport with the people who are now their responsibility
NEVENT : But there are still problems bringing control to Baghdad, particularly at nighttime
NEVENT : In the pitch black of a city without power, these soldiers manning a roadblock became nervous
NEVENT : Stay the backBack up
NEVENT : Bullets are sprayed everywhere
NEVENT : In parts of Baghdad that the Americans haven't yet reached, there has been looting
NEVENT : This man took the horse from a stable at the home of Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son
NEVENT : We found the house, a large, gaudy structure, a place that just a few days ago people didn't even look at for fear of their lives
NEVENT : This indeed was one of Uday's homes
NEVENT : Here, the ruling family could look out over the Tigris
NEVENT : People have wasted no time clearing the house and wrecking what couldn't be easily taken
NEVENT : They haven't quite worked out just how to reach this will chandelier yet
NEVENT : But, other than that, they have stripped this place bare in less than 24 hours
NEVENT : Call it plunder, if you will, or perhaps payback
NEVENT : These Iraqis were rifling a home of a senior member of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's dreaded secret police
NEVENT : It also seemed to be some kind of monitoring station
NEVENT : There was sophisticated equipment here
NEVENT : In the basement, we found burning archives and evidence of electronic surveillance
NEVENT : This had been a nerve center for spying, a place from where the bully boys kept tabs to keep control
NEVENT : We're now in the bowels of a secret police monitoring station
NEVENT : Look at all this gadgetry, quite sinister really, part of the apparatus of Big Brother
NEVENT : These people are stealing from a shopping center
NEVENT : It has become widespread, but it's not being done with total impunity
NEVENT : John Irvine, ITV News, Baghdad
NEVENT : Some pictures
NEVENT : Well, Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family members in Iraq
NEVENT : Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National Endowment for Democracy
NEVENT : He is also the president of a group of Iraqi exiles, a group called the Iraq National Group
NEVENT : He joins us now from London to talk about rebuilding his country
NEVENT : Mr. Kubba, first of all, your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of Baghdad, the Saddam Hussein regime falling in the last day
NEVENT : And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered more
NEVENT : So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse
NEVENT : But, obviously, there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing on television
NEVENT : Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq
NEVENT : And, if you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness
NEVENT : Well, not in the recent three or four days
NEVENT : There are no phone lines to Baghdad
NEVENT : So those signs to me are worrying
NEVENT : People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it
NEVENT : And the more they test, the more I think they are claiming
NEVENT : How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is in charge
NEVENT : Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements
NEVENT : Today, there should be an authority
NEVENT : And it's very likely that the U.S. and the British forces are the authority on land
NEVENT : And there ought to be administration
NEVENT : And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis
NEVENT : But when it comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections
NEVENT : We need to involve the U.N.
NEVENT : We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country, outside the country
NEVENT : But we need to do it quickly, because every day passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble
NEVENT : Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence
NEVENT : Is one of them going to have an advantage
NEVENT : I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington
NEVENT : It's totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq
NEVENT : And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington
NEVENT : It must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq
NEVENT : And there are 22 million people there
NEVENT : It's not a void
NEVENT : It's not a vacuum
NEVENT : And I think all plans must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality
NEVENT : So does one group have an advantage over another now
NEVENT : There are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country
NEVENT : Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice
NEVENT : But we do not have a single group, a single leadership or a single council yet
NEVENT : We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of Iraqi exiles
NEVENT : The group is called the Iraq National Group
NEVENT : Mr. Kubba, we thank you so much for talking to us from London
NEVENT : Thank you
NEVENT : We appreciate it
NEVENT : Thank you
NEVENT : Here in Washington, members of the House of Representatives come together to support America's armed forces
NEVENT : One of the toughest jobs in Iraq right now is that of the military doctor
NEVENT : Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story
NEVENT : Some we'll never know
NEVENT : Nobody knows these stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never look the other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching
NEVENT : They are often the first faces the injured see, be they Iraqi or coalition force members
NEVENT : The work of the Devil Docs is by no means over
NEVENT : The Navy has set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile operating room, just on the outskirts of Baghdad
NEVENT : This is the closest front line surgical company
NEVENT : It is there the doctors begin their work
NEVENT : The operations are on their hands, abdomen and face
NEVENT : Two of the Marines, too far gone
NEVENT : For many of the survivors, that news is the most difficult to handle
NEVENT : Along with the medical care, hands are held, spirits are lifted
NEVENT : Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN with the Devil Docs outside Baghdad
NEVENT : CNN's Ryan Chilcote reports the 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade finds 11 of what an Army general describes as chem-bio labs buried to avoid detection near Karbala, each of the structures 20-by- 20 feet
NEVENT : And the military also found over 1,000 pounds of documents buried at the site
NEVENT : U.S. inspections will continue there
NEVENT : Well, Baghdad is a city where drinking water and working telephones are hot commodities
NEVENT : Now, regular cell phones rarely work these days in the city, we're told, but satellite phones are another story entirely
NEVENT : CNN's Rula Amin reports from the Iraqi capital
NEVENT : They wait for hours to find a journalist and they plead with us to borrow our mobile satellite phones
NEVENT : They need to send a message to their families abroad just to tell them, We are alive, says this woman
NEVENT : Here, they wait outside a restaurant where journalists hang out
NEVENT : And they are desperate
NEVENT : Only for one minute, says this mother
NEVENT : It's not good for her to worry about us, she says
NEVENT : Across the fence, a 21-year-old U.S. Marine named Jason Cook is after the same phones
NEVENT : A New York Times reporter lends Cook his mobile sat phone
NEVENT : I love you too, mom
NEVENT : Hey, old man
NEVENT : I'm in the middle of Baghdad, just patrolling up and down the streets
NEVENT : Cook hasn't spoken to his family since Super Bowl Sunday, January 26
NEVENT : My mother, brother and sister
NEVENT : How many do you have
NEVENT : I got an older brother and a little brother and sister
NEVENT : His mother told him to keep his head down
NEVENT : She didn't believe I was really talking to her
NEVENT : We do our share
NEVENT : Nevertheless, the mother is happy
NEVENT : We couldn't accommodate everybody
NEVENT : Rula Amin, CNN, Baghdad
NEVENT : Makes you wish they had enough satellite phones to go around for everybody
NEVENT : Thanks, Rula
NEVENT : the commander-in-chief's political future
NEVENT : And Idaho Air National Guardsman Major Gregory Stone was buried with honors at Arlington
NEVENT : And that is it for this special edition of INSIDE POLITICS
NEVENT : I'm Judy Woodruff
NEVENT : We thank you for joining us
NEVENT : Hooters Air is a spin-off of a restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses
NEVENT : But a local Republican official insists there will not be any Hooters girls onboard with the 100-year-old Thurmond
NEVENT : Smiles
NEVENT : That's it for INSIDE POLITICS
NEVENT : I'm Judy Woodruff
NEVENT : Thanks for joining us
NEVENT : Welcome back to LATE EDITION
NEVENT : We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld
NEVENT : Well, I guess time will tell
NEVENT : He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do
NEVENT : We'll see what progress comes
NEVENT : You know, words are one thing, actions are another
NEVENT : I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful
NEVENT : I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful, and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future
NEVENT : In my view, they were making some unwise decisions previously
NEVENT : What they'll do after this visit remains to be seen
NEVENT : Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals
NEVENT : All right, tell me what
NEVENT : It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so long
NEVENT : There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign nationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and those countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time
NEVENT : Colin and I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about
NEVENT : Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go
NEVENT : Victory parades for the troops
NEVENT : I remember covering General Schwarzkopf, the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War
NEVENT : There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be
NEVENT : And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated
NEVENT : What's the best way to do that
NEVENT : In this instance, it was a very different task
NEVENT : We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks
NEVENT : And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well
NEVENT : Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know
NEVENT : I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance
NEVENT : One final question on North Korea
NEVENT : If the North Koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : I'm not one who speculates about things like that
NEVENT : But those are very serious issues, and I leave them for the president
NEVENT : President Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, formally declaring the successful accomplishment of the military mission in Iraq
NEVENT : Welcome back to LATE EDITION
NEVENT : Joining us now are two key members of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee
NEVENT : In his home state of Indiana, the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Richard Lugar
NEVENT : And here in Washington, Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut
NEVENT : Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION
NEVENT : Mr. Chairman, let me begin with you
NEVENT : Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S
NEVENT : may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
NEVENT : No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are
NEVENT : What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more
NEVENT : Because not much else is you don't need much to get it going again
NEVENT : And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program
NEVENT : What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction
NEVENT : I have no evidence to the contrary
NEVENT : There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population
NEVENT : So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case possibly some got out of the country
NEVENT : It wouldn't surprise me to hear that
NEVENT : But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed
NEVENT : What if they don't
NEVENT : So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons
NEVENT : He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq
NEVENT : Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr
NEVENT : Chairman, if, if the U.S
NEVENT : finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun
NEVENT : No, we have full credibility in Iraq
NEVENT : We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them
NEVENT : That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important
NEVENT : Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : Well, it's important
NEVENT : But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is
NEVENT : So, it would certainly be good to know where he is
NEVENT : And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman
NEVENT : Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on
NEVENT : What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, Senator Lugar
NEVENT : How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will remain there
NEVENT : Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no longer than necessary
NEVENT : I think that's a pretty good way to state it
NEVENT : My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently
NEVENT : We are trying to pass that on to others
NEVENT : Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on democracy, and all the rest
NEVENT : But that's going to require an undergirding
NEVENT : Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other countries
NEVENT : We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world
NEVENT : That would be helpful
NEVENT : But for the moment, this is our responsibility
NEVENT : And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out
NEVENT : And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone
NEVENT : I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today
NEVENT : And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the cost to U.S
NEVENT : taxpayers
NEVENT : Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States
NEVENT : No
NEVENT : Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $100 billion
NEVENT : We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental appropriations bill
NEVENT : So it's going to be costly
NEVENT : These RFPs, these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to be expensive
NEVENT : And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States
NEVENT : And to the extent we can move that along more quickly, I think we're all going to be better off
NEVENT : Being the sole, or almost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction and politically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities
NEVENT : Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted to just ask you, the U.N. role you say there could be a U.N. role
NEVENT : Do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there
NEVENT : No, I don't want anybody shut out
NEVENT : And I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways, and I hope that that will occur soon
NEVENT : I think we really need an internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator Dodd pointed out
NEVENT : All right
NEVENT : We're going to take that quick break
NEVENT : Stand by, Senators
NEVENT : We have a lot more ground to cover
NEVENT : Senators Lugar and Dodd will be staying with us
NEVENT : LATE EDITION will continue right after this
NEVENT : i just want to update you on kofi annan's remarks
NEVENT : the u.n. secretary-general did not answer questions on iraq as a result
NEVENT : there's nothing to report on that front
NEVENT : we have just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the pledge of allegiance in public classrooms
NEVENT : schools in nine western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting monday
NEVENT : the appeals court ruled last summer, but the phrase under god which was ad ded to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion
NEVENT : here's how you're weighing in on our web question of the day
NEVENT : remember when we've been asking you this question
NEVENT : who is the number one threat facing the u.s
NEVENT : is it saddam hussein, kim jong il or osama bin laden
NEVENT : look at the results
NEVENT : 13%% of you say saddam hussein
NEVENT : 14% of you who voted say kim jong il, 41% say osama bin laden
NEVENT : remember, this is not, not a 13, 46, 4 1, those are the numbers
NEVENT : you see them, 13% for saddam hussein, 46% for kim jong il, 41% for osama bin laden
NEVENT : remember this, ask not a scientific poll,
NEVENT : it's with wednesday, march 5 200 3
NEVENT : i'm wolf blitzer in washington
NEVENT : secretary of state colin powell acted like a prosecutor, pointing out iraq's failures
NEVENT : even the vatican voiced concerns today
NEVENT : welcome back
NEVENT : 25 minutes after the hour
NEVENT : time for the cafferty file
NEVENT : good morning
NEVENT : a crazy world we live in
NEVENT : the supreme court of the united states upheld the toughest three strikes law in the country yesterday
NEVENT : that's california's
NEVENT : the voters overwhelmingly passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist
NEVENT : one-third of them not that
NEVENT : 300 of them are in there for things like petty theft
NEVENT : 25 other states that have the three strikes law
NEVENT : and that brings us to the question
NEVENT : it was a close vote
NEVENT : 5-4 in the supreme court
NEVENT : here is the question of the day
NEVENT : that is the
NEVENT : record temperatures in the north
NEVENT : threatening right now to freeze over lake superior surface
NEVENT : if so, forecasters say it will be the first time there in about two decades
NEVENT : lake superior, the largest of the five great lakes
NEVENT : it doesn't look too frozen there
NEVENT : all this happening about 90 minutes ago based on the wire reports we're getting here
NEVENT : the morning papers, because morning papers around the country and around the world are remaking their front page to include the elizabeth smart case, and we end with that tonight
NEVENT : with her family on a day when their miracle finally came true
NEVENT : she looks very, very healthy
NEVENT : she's grown a lot
NEVENT : and i'm just so absolutely thrilled
NEVENT : i couldn't believe it
NEVENT : in fact, i had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say, is it really you? all of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way the way elizabeth has come back to us
NEVENT : and we need to have this here
NEVENT : we really do
NEVENT : but i just am so grateful and so thankful
NEVENT : thank you very much
NEVENT : can you describe elizabeth's demeanor
NEVENT : you said she looked good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal
NEVENT : is she still scared
NEVENT : she excited
NEVENT : happy
NEVENT : i don't know
NEVENT : i mean, it was just i'm sure she was just thrilled to be back
NEVENT : i just such happiness and such love
NEVENT : and i just held her, held her the whole way home
NEVENT : do miracles still exist
NEVENT : and the answer is yes
NEVENT : and we have elizabeth back
NEVENT : this neighborhood, the federal heights neighborhood, everybody's been ripped up, everybody's helped, everybody's prayed to do whatever they can
NEVENT : we thank god for all the searchers, for all the people
NEVENT : in the history of the world i don't think a little girl's been prayed for more than elizabeth smart
NEVENT : and we thank you for answering those prayers
NEVENT : thank you
NEVENT : it's a nice day to have this job
NEVENT : we'll see you tomorrow, 10:00 eastern time
NEVENT : captions by vitac www.vitac.com a ceo is about to announce employee of the year
NEVENT : earlier, several go-getters prepared to accept their award
NEVENT : and when i began this journey when i started this journey me
NEVENT : i had no idea i'd
NEVENT : that her younger sister, mary katherine, was the one who went to her father and said, dad, i think i know who did this
NEVENT : but it took some four months before they were able to get a picture and identify the picture as this brian david mitchell and then his wife, wanda barzee
NEVENT : the other questions, of course, are why didn't elizabeth smart try to escae
NEVENT : were there opportunities perhaps that she might ab vible to able to get away from her abductors
NEVENT : the police are saying she was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on
NEVENT : we are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out that show the three, that show mitchell, his wife, and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in september
NEVENT : there were times perhaps they were in a park somewhere in salt lake city completely robed in these veiled and robes so you could not see her face
NEVENT : there are a lot of questions coming out about why she could not get away from them, that remains to be answered
NEVENT : the police are going to be holding a press conference later today
NEVENT : we're hoping to get more details about that
NEVENT : you've heard the old saying, the best offense is a good defense
NEVENT : what does this mean if you're traveling you might ask
NEVENT : to cnn's patty davis at reagan national airport
NEVENT : what are travelers to do and, for that matter, not to do
NEVENT : miles, what that means is tighter security at airports across the country
NEVENT : and that could potentially slow you down
NEVENT : some things you may want to do is, first all, just get here a little bit early
NEVENT : now, homeland security chief tom ridge described some of those new security measures on top of the ones that are already in place
NEVENT : begin the training for the pilots in the cockpits with firearms
NEVENT : then you've got the hardened cockpit doors
NEVENT : you have training for the flight attendants
NEVENT : you have more federal air marshals
NEVENT : you come outside the airline the airplane itself and you have technology, 100% inspection of baggage
NEVENT : you have new trained inspectors for passengers
NEVENT : you enhance airport security outside the perimeter
NEVENT : airports are currently
NEVENT : we are watching activity in baghdad
NEVENT : thank you very much
NEVENT : a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s
NEVENT : forces are now and their ultimate destination, downtown baghdad
NEVENT : we have the city laid out for you here
NEVENT : how many bridges in this city alone
NEVENT : in this map we have right here, 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad, including the expressway bridge over here
NEVENT : three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area
NEVENT : this is one technique, one possible way u.s
NEVENT : forces might seize a bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis
NEVENT : let's look at the animation
NEVENT : typical scenario there
NEVENT : it doesn't really matter for this scenario that we're laying out here
NEVENT : you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge
NEVENT : potentially chemical weapons, too
NEVENT : as we turn the other direction, what you'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there
NEVENT : they have burns in front of them
NEVENT : and then they there goes the smoke screen
NEVENT : it doesn't work, though
NEVENT : it works both ways
NEVENT : it obscures you but also obscures them
NEVENT : here's an f-16
NEVENT : he comes in and wants to identify his target and he's got a big
NEVENT : can't see through the smoke
NEVENT : we've got some techniques we're going to show you
NEVENT : somewhere near we can put down special
NEVENT : on we go in the meantime
NEVENT : yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions
NEVENT : today the evidence is somewhat more tangible
NEVENT : reporting for us, cnn's david ensor
NEVENT : gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches
NEVENT : in nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital u.s
NEVENT : marines found weapons, atropine antidote kits, and that was not all
NEVENT : they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms
NEVENT : there is also intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents
NEVENT : in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government's stand it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction
NEVENT : when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines
NEVENT : but as our candy crowley reminds us, life does and must go on
NEVENT : spring-time and a game of catch on the washington mall
NEVENT : a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific ocean
NEVENT : that other place, the one on tv all the time, might as well be on another planet
NEVENT : and that may be the point
NEVENT : we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage, everything, and kind of relax
NEVENT : time to redefine normal again, which on the homefront now seems to mean life as you live it only weirder
NEVENT : i'm amazed at how unaffected i am by things, how i'm still coming to work and doing the same things and going for a walk in the morning
NEVENT : and it just seems so strange to me that it's almost a parallel universe
NEVENT : the barber at hinsville georgia larries that
NEVENT : they seem more depressed
NEVENT : a lot of them afraid they're going to lose their jobs, you know, the economy is down and all kind of stuff
NEVENT : life on the homefront seems the same at farmer's market in los angeles, but it's more angst ridden
NEVENT : i don't think it's affecting our business as much as i was worried that it would, but you never know it's going to happen
NEVENT : nationwide, people shopped less in the first week of the war
NEVENT : sales fell 2 percent from the previous week
NEVENT : my boyfriend has been watching the tv like every single day, every time it comes on, he's watching it
NEVENT : maybe fewer people are shoning because they're watching tv
NEVENT : there's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn, it's an overall feeling, a psychological feeling that everything is frozen, everything is on hold
NEVENT : consumers aren't spending, people aren't buying stock, everything is
NEVENT : cnn's jamie kolbe is there reporting, jamie on these families who are saying good-bye to their loved ones
NEVENT : their equipment that left on january is now on a ship on its way south through the suez canal and it's interesting to note some of the equipment that's been held up for the last couple of months, there are some 5 helicopters, 200 tanks as well as 150 bradley infantry fighting vehicles
NEVENT : these are highly trained soldiers
NEVENT : they are ready to go
NEVENT : their mission is very broad, judy to deploy anywhere in the world in support of national strategy
NEVENT : they doan know what they'll be doing
NEVENT : they will learn that once they get there their first stop will be to central command, they'll receive more specific orders
NEVENT : they will be join by the first cavalry
NEVENT : they have received deployment orders
NEVENT : they have not yet been told to make final arrangements
NEVENT : they are ready
NEVENT : they are determined and they are very patriotic in support of our country
NEVENT : judy
NEVENT : it's i don't think we can say it often enough, jamie
NEVENT : it's got
NEVENT : today's battles include pictures of the oil field fires in southern iraq
NEVENT : firefighters continue their work at the ramallah oil field
NEVENT : officials say they capped one blaze, leaving only two wells still burning out of 500 oil fields in the area
NEVENT : aless so vinci is there with the marines
NEVENT : the company which lost nearly $4 billion over the past two years has cut its annual costs by nearly $2 billion
NEVENT : most of that was saved by cutting employee wages and benefits
NEVENT : the dow is down
NEVENT : you see there, just about almost 140 points
NEVENT : nasdaq down 20 and the s&p is down, as well
NEVENT : so the markets are continuing their negative trend from last week
NEVENT : we'll keep our i on that
NEVENT : is it a taste of more to come in iraq
NEVENT : now a spokesman from the central command is saying and i'm quoting frankly, we have bigger and more important things to do
NEVENT : during a live broadcast geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to baghdad
NEVENT : you know, they can't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they're trying to stab me in the back
NEVENT : it is not first time
NEVENT : we showed you the statements yesterday
NEVENT : today he appeared on on nbc's today show and said he was sorry
NEVENT : i want to apologize to the american people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to iraqi television
NEVENT : but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi television, i created a firestorm in the united states
NEVENT : and for that i am truly sorry
NEVENT : but the question remains did peter arnett and geraldo rivera cross the line
NEVENT : or were they within their rights as reporters
NEVENT : we posed that question to michael wolf, a contributing editor for new york magazine, a media columnist, an important article in the new issue of new york
NEVENT : he's joining us now live from qatar
NEVENT : what do you say to the question, michael
NEVENT : well, you know, i think i'm
NEVENT : president bush said yesterday the threat of domestic terrorism remains high
NEVENT : they're wrong
NEVENT : what still needs to be done to keep americans safe at home, steven berle tacks that issue in after how america confronted the september 12th era
NEVENT : congratulations
NEVENT : thank you
NEVENT : what comes out yesterday, on two best-sellers list
NEVENT : so far, so good
NEVENT : you've spent over a year investigating the subject
NEVENT : you had unprecedented access not only to secretary ridge but the attorney general and other player in this post-september 11th environment
NEVENT : how vulnerable do we continue to be
NEVENT : well, quite vulnerable in some places and yet we've made great strides
NEVENT : the access i had was not only at top but the people who were on the front lines
NEVENT : and this is really the behind the scenes story of everything they had been doing to make this country safer
NEVENT : i think we decided on the morning of september 12th we're not going to be victim, we're not just going to sit there
NEVENT : we're going to try to do something
NEVENT : in the ports, at the airports, even with our food supply, we have taken all kinds of steps
NEVENT : but we are vulnerable
NEVENT : we're vulnerable right out on the streets here
NEVENT : we're vulnerable in mass transit systems because we can't involve this problem infin any lu we've made good strides in the last we're
NEVENT : that's the story i try to to tell about the men and women who have brought us this point
NEVENT : can the
NEVENT : the hijacker got off the plane wearing a jacket that said, america across the back
NEVENT : and a small child clinging to his leg
NEVENT : coalition field commanders say u.s. troops are now within 15 miles of the iraqi capital
NEVENT : u.s. troops could be in baghdad southern outskirts by early thursday
NEVENT : for the second straight day, iraqi television meanwhile has broadcast a statement from the iraqi president saddam hussein
NEVENT : however, despite the appearance of saddam hussein in and what was said to be new fattage, the statement itself was read by an iraqi news anchor wearing a military uniform
NEVENT : iraqi forces are overwhelmed and could soon collapse
NEVENT : what a brave young woman
NEVENT : she was captured but she was one tough cookie, apparently
NEVENT : god bless here
NEVENT : and she's going to be all right, it looks like
NEVENT : we have some other items, voices of america they're called her on american morning
NEVENT : we begin in oklahoma, a story of sacrifice in wartime
NEVENT : alexis jane denise, but without her husband
NEVENT : john scottsdale is on the front lines in iraq
NEVENT : i don't know what to do
NEVENT : his parents have stepped in to help with their new granddaughter and it looks as though mother and daughter are doing well
NEVENT : voices of america on a morning where it looks like things gring well for the coalition members
NEVENT : did you hear the family members of jessica lynch yesterday
NEVENT : they said it was a miraculous thing
NEVENT : they've tried these things before, but never with the success
NEVENT : i guess miracle isn't too strong a word
NEVENT : it's a great word
NEVENT : when you heard her father talk
NEVENT : welcome jeffrey to be in
NEVENT : he thought it
NEVENT : all right
NEVENT : just about 25 minutes long in that press conference there at nato headquarters in brussels
NEVENT : he mentioned a headline a short time ago
NEVENT : colin powell saying an end will come soon and toward the end, this regime will be finished
NEVENT : also a question there about the united nations
NEVENT : a question about nato about what role these two organizations may play in rebuilding iraq
NEVENT : colin powell says the u.n
NEVENT : does have a role to play, what role that is remains to be seen
NEVENT : there was also one other moment there when you heard a woman asking about the safety of her husband right now
NEVENT : we have heard that perhaps both are being held in basra, possibly in a hospital, but there's no way for us to confirm their whereabouts, but obviously a lot of concern from this woman as to where whereabouts of her husband and his health
NEVENT : walt rogers is back with us
NEVENT : we've been in and out now for almost two hours
NEVENT : what's happening with you and the 7th cav as we continue to watch your image by way of video phone and the giant m1-a1 tank
NEVENT : walt, good evening again
NEVENT : if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m
NEVENT : in baghdad, live pictures again
NEVENT : again, correspondents, our correspondents with the embedded with these forces, with them in the field, saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad
NEVENT : as you know, the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein's regime, in principal
NEVENT : the so-called medina division, and the baghdad division
NEVENT : the baghdad division, of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad
NEVENT : so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad
NEVENT : we will continue to monitor that
NEVENT : tim hewart of itn reports
NEVENT : the pentagon says the strategy is to seize key objectives in and around baghdad
NEVENT : coalition aircraft were heard flying overhead
NEVENT : it's not clear what the targets are
NEVENT : certainly, some of them near and around saddam hussein international airport although there have been strikes in central baghdad as well
NEVENT : in the course of the past hour
NEVENT : the 3rd infantry is approaching from the southwest, the 1st marines from the southeast
NEVENT : iraqi forces using soviet-era tanks
NEVENT : they stand no chance against the m1 abrams tanks used by army and marines
NEVENT : central command has determined that baghdad airport is unusable for normal air operations
NEVENT : the airport, for the most part, is now under u.s. control
NEVENT : military officials will not say whether damage to the runways is going to limit operation there, but they know there are underground bunkers there and some other areas that may be of use
NEVENT : centcom also says 2500 republican guard troops have surrendered to u.s. marines between kut and baghdad
NEVENT : military officials say the baghdad republican guard division is no longer an effective fighting force
NEVENT : we turn now to an iraqi first of all, before we tell you about this story, we were going to, these are live pictures from baghdad
NEVENT : there's been some activity in the last few moments
NEVENT : you can see it there just now
NEVENT : we've been reporting, the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on
NEVENT : we don't know that all ofist is back, but at least some of it is
NEVENT : but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport
NEVENT : again, this is these are live pictures of baghdad, where it is well into the night
NEVENT : we're, of course, going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn
NEVENT : looking at like pictures of heirs force one now on the ground at a royal air force base outside of belfast, northern ireland
NEVENT : it's called aldergrove, just outside belfast
NEVENT : they'll also have an opportunity to review the so-called road map for israeli/palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground
NEVENT : they also want to review what the status is of northern ireland right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold
NEVENT : been relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few years
NEVENT : go forward as close allies in trying to help put together a new iraq
NEVENT : there are some significant differences in their strategy, including what role precisely the united nations should have in determining the future of iraq
NEVENT : they'll try to thrash all of that out
NEVENT : you're look at the picture of air force one taxiing in on the tarmac, getting ready for the president
NEVENT : seems pretty far away from belfast right now, general
NEVENT : but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq
NEVENT : first of all, general, we'll keep this picture up of air force one, talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of baghdad right now
NEVENT : wolf, it's clearly the final phase
NEVENT : the engame which is unfoaling right now
NEVENT : i think it's very significant not only in baghdad but basra itself
NEVENT : you have coalition forces there in some strength
NEVENT : apparently three ba talians of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition assets, three huge battle groups in basra itself which the u.k
NEVENT : has there, what they've developed here, wolf, over the last several weeks i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are embedded in the cities
NEVENT : but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that's where these key leaders are located
NEVENT : this is a very important final phase here, wolf, and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated
NEVENT : as we continue to watch air force one, now on the ground outside belfast, northern ireland, we'll be watching president bush emerge from the plane momentarily
NEVENT : we'll continue to have live coverage of that
NEVENT : when walter rodgers, our embedded reporter with the 3-7th cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground, inside baghdad itself, have taken up positions they're going to spend the night there presumably, how many soldiers are we talking about right now
NEVENT : between 700 and 1,000
NEVENT : the task forces really, wolf are probably built around the m-2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle
NEVENT : it is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad
NEVENT : it's a very, very important piece of equipment
NEVENT : these are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support
NEVENT : it's significant the degradation of the iraqi air defenses has allowed a-10s, predators, u-s, other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task
NEVENT : welcome back n case you're just tuning in, our top story this hour, the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural complex in central iraq
NEVENT : initial tests were inconclusive
NEVENT : the general benjamin frankly of the 101st says today a more sophisticated test indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents
NEVENT : he says that type of test that is required sometimes shows false-positives and further testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed nonweaponized chemical agents or perhaps simply pesticides
NEVENT : general frankly says it is hard to believe u.n
NEVENT : inspectors would have found the facility hidden as deeply as it was near the euphrates river
NEVENT : we'll are much more on this developing story coming up in a few minutes
NEVENT : what's happening there tonight, gary
NEVENT : well, wolf, the air force is continuing its 24-hour air coverage over baghdad
NEVENT : there will always be multiple warplanes, fighter
NEVENT : we're going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off this chopper
NEVENT : as you probably know, the prime minister of the great britain has been under great pressure at home and much of europe to support giving the united nations a very strong role in stabilizing iraq
NEVENT : the white house had signaled consistently it wants the united states and great britain to create a lead role
NEVENT : we learned from john king, traveling with the president, that the new iraq run neither by u.s./british coalition or united nations, but by the iraqi people
NEVENT : the president went on to say that an interim authority composed of iraq grs inside and outside the country will run iraq until a permanent government can be established
NEVENT : do you want to hang with the shot
NEVENT : okay, we're going to stay with this shot
NEVENT : they really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the u.n
NEVENT : involvement might be to not worry
NEVENT : they said there will definitely be some kind of role for the united nations, they think it's very important for the european nations to be on board with the plan, but once again, they very much view the future of iraq as being that in iraqi hands
NEVENT : the president greeting a number of dignitaries as he gets ready here to board air force one on his way home
NEVENT : a little earlier this morning, i spoke with an iraqi dissident who teaches at writes extensively on the middle east
NEVENT : he wrote a book called the republic of fear
NEVENT : the politics of modern iraq
NEVENT : hamburg, germany
NEVENT : it happened near the baghdad airport which is in u.s. hands
NEVENT : pilot said they're doing well
NEVENT : all right
NEVENT : they found it at an industrial complex
NEVENT : material has been haiftly abandon
NEVENT : these figures come to us from abu dhabi television
NEVENT : they cannot be verified by cnn
NEVENT : the iraqi government has not released the information or military casualties at all
NEVENT : 5:33 a.m., martin savidge says the marines have found chemical protection suits and antidotes for chemical weapons in a field beside an industrial complex in southeast baghdad
NEVENT : nearby they found abandoned weapons and artillery case, which they demolished
NEVENT : the pilot ejected and was rescued
NEVENT : an air force pilot is back at his base after a close call
NEVENT : cnn's gary tuchman is live near the iraqi border with details on the mission and the pilot's rescue
NEVENT : gary
NEVENT : wolf, hello to you
NEVENT : it was a very tense and nerve-racking day for the pilot who is stationed at this base near the iraqi border
NEVENT : took it out early this morning
NEVENT : here's what happened to him
NEVENT : he realized the plane was going to crash so he ejected
NEVENT : all these planes have ejection seats
NEVENT : the pilots carry parachutes
NEVENT : he is in good condition with the 172nd fire squadron which is based in battle creek, michigan
NEVENT : but he's a very lucky man
NEVENT : he's with two other a-10s flying along with him
NEVENT : one came back to the base
NEVENT : the other we have a picture of
NEVENT : it landed at a base controlled by the coalition
NEVENT : the pilot also was able to make a safe landing and neither of those pilots were hurt
NEVENT : we have video of that plane
NEVENT : that plane has a role in one of the engines
NEVENT : stabilizer in the back of the plane
NEVENT : the pilot lost all flight control as she was flying back
NEVENT : thinking about ejecting
NEVENT : decided she could make it back safely
NEVENT : course, we just heard from jamie mcintyre about the f-15 e strike eagle
NEVENT : authorities
NEVENT : the u.s. attorney says padilla is an enemy combattant and not entitled to counsel
NEVENT : until southern iraq, another symbol of saddam hussein's regime is in ruins tonight
NEVENT : saddam hussein's private yacht and quite a yacht it is or was
NEVENT : the boat was one of the world's most luxurious yachts when it was launched some 20 years ago
NEVENT : now the scorched hulk floats aimlessly in the arab waterway next to basra's dock yards
NEVENT : also, the long journey of the marine who covered the statue of saddam hussein with an american flag
NEVENT : bill tucker will have a special report on the life of marine corporal edward chin
NEVENT : and actress jane fonda is now questioning freedom of the united states
NEVENT : and she has a few thoughts about ignorance
NEVENT : so do we
NEVENT : stay with us
NEVENT : now that saddam hussein's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to iraq and its people
NEVENT : in his book, fareed zakar ericks a joins us now to talk about democracy and iraq's future
NEVENT : good to see you
NEVENT : thank you, paula
NEVENT : good to see you on a different network for a change
NEVENT : that's what happens when you sell books
NEVENT : i know
NEVENT : let's talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon
NEVENT : she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq
NEVENT : do you think the administration underestimated the day after
NEVENT : i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way
NEVENT : i think that there's been a pattern here not just with this administration, but over the last ten years, bosnia, kosovo, afghanistan, where we don't quite recognize when the old order collapses, you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order
NEVENT : in the short-term, that's going to have to mean the american military
NEVENT : but the key question, which i try to address in the book, is what do you do after that
NEVENT : what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition
NEVENT : and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or, in fact, interested in democracy
NEVENT : there's no proof of that
NEVENT : well, the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections
NEVENT : but if you hold elections, you stop the whole process of building a rule of law, creating courts, creating administration
NEVENT : there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority, but the faster you get that, the more likely you stop this process
NEVENT : so what do you think of this interim government
NEVENT : you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process
NEVENT : is that going to work
NEVENT : i think it will work if it's truly broad-based and truly consensual, try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years
NEVENT : what i point out is the plays where you've had quick transitions
NEVENT : a michigan teen who disappeared with a convicted killer and went on a three-week oddysey is in trouble with the law tonight
NEVENT : police caught up with the two in california
NEVENT : we try to bring you the work of still photographers who are applying their trade in iraq these days
NEVENT : tonight patrick baas from afp looking at what he's done this week
NEVENT : it is clear he has two of the things you need to be a photo photojournalist
NEVENT : a great eye and nose for where the news is
NEVENT : it's like my life
NEVENT : we recognized them because of their uniform
NEVENT : very close to the u.s. marines uniform
NEVENT : i didn't see fear in their eyes
NEVENT : it was an american tank that had techmy call problems
NEVENT : they really believed on the tank
NEVENT : i was taking pictures
NEVENT : the reporter was with me
NEVENT : wanted to go in
NEVENT : i said, no
NEVENT : while
NEVENT : in were also big celebrations at ft
NEVENT : hood, texas, home base to two other p.o.w.s, david williams and ronald young
NEVENT : today, their families are learning new and actually harrowing details about the days after their capture
NEVENT : cnn national correspondent susan candiotti is with the young family in georgia, jamie cole by at ft
NEVENT : hood, texas, where she spoke to williams' wife michelle
NEVENT : susan, why don't we start with you
NEVENT : hello, judy
NEVENT : however, the family did get in a company of questions about how he was treated
NEVENT : they learned he lost 20 pound pounds and also their son told them that in the last few days of his capture, things weren't so bad but that they were very rough in the beginning
NEVENT : their son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in georgia, after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him, finally, for the very first time in three weeks, the young family members got some sleep last night for the first time in a long time
NEVENT : well, at least some family members did
NEVENT : she slept pretty good
NEVENT : i'm not kidding
NEVENT : all right
NEVENT : i got in there, laid downer she must have took a pill or something
NEVENT : sounded like a saw mill going on next to me
NEVENT : back on the couch again
NEVENT : hey, i was tired
NEVENT : and besides, it was relief, you know
NEVENT : i could finally sleep and know everything was okay
NEVENT : of course, pictures and videotape and a phone call is one thing
NEVENT : but seeing their son in person is quite another
NEVENT : and they are, of course, hoping that will happen very soon
NEVENT : back to you, judy
NEVENT : at least, we would think, if that's the case
NEVENT : thanks very much
NEVENT : let's turn to jamie at ft
NEVENT : hood, texas, where she's been talking with the family of chief warrant officer david williams
NEVENT : for them, jamie, begin what we just heard about the knife at his throat, they must be incredibly relieved
NEVENT : you know, judy, they have been learning more and more as the day goes on
NEVENT : the focus is clearly not on their treatment or their capture but their freedom
NEVENT : for three weeks she's watched and waited for some news
NEVENT : the only other pictures was his abandoned helicopter
NEVENT : she knew instantly when she saw it, because of the 1st cavalry emblem and special markings it was his
NEVENT : it's been a long three weeks
NEVENT : today is date she was waiting for
NEVENT : ihood a chance to spend some time with her yesterday
NEVENT : this morning on american morning she told us about what her reaction was when she saw those first pictures of her husband free
NEVENT : i was so happy
NEVENT : he i knew i never lost hope that he was alive and just seeing him and being able to see his eyes and his reaction to his rescue just took a huge load off my shoulders
NEVENT : incredible support from military spouses, but this is a true love story
NEVENT : they have been at ft
NEVENT : hood for a short time
NEVENT : both are pilots
NEVENT : michelle is
NEVENT : we begin we will finish
NEVENT : the extra $400 per child to american families this year, 2003
NEVENT : all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans
NEVENT : and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan
NEVENT : a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes
NEVENT : instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year
NEVENT : that means extra money in the family budget year after year
NEVENT : that money can cover a lot of bills
NEVENT : that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying
NEVENT : that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy
NEVENT : and this plan will help our small business sector
NEVENT : the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves
NEVENT : it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates
NEVENT : most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation
NEVENT : as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut
NEVENT : which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation
NEVENT : a growing economy also needs small business investment
NEVENT : and our tax code should encourage investment
NEVENT : today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment
NEVENT : we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment
NEVENT : so i propose to congress that they ought to limit limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation
NEVENT : by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery
NEVENT : and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available
NEVENT : more investment equals jobs
NEVENT : and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job
NEVENT : we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends
NEVENT : taxing corporate income once is fair
NEVENT : it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice
NEVENT : the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends
NEVENT : falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income
NEVENT : removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors
NEVENT : it would encourage more investment in american businesses
NEVENT : economists say that this plan will help our stock markets, and since half of american families own stock, the reform will help them save and help our economy grow
NEVENT : now, these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year
NEVENT : the pro growth package was urgent in january
NEVENT : it's even more urgent today
NEVENT : it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004
NEVENT : which has caused our government to run a deficit
NEVENT : the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c.
NEVENT : i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint
NEVENT : and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package
NEVENT : we need at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in this economy
NEVENT : the last few months have been a time of challenge for america
NEVENT : our resolve has been tested
NEVENT : yet we have the great resources of national strength
NEVENT : and national character
NEVENT : to overcome every challenge we face
NEVENT : our confidence an our optimism have never waivered
NEVENT : we are defending the peace of the world
NEVENT : we're bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in years
NEVENT : we're all building the prosperity of our country
NEVENT : this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it
NEVENT : i want to thank each of you for your hard work
NEVENT : i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's future
NEVENT : may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america
NEVENT : spy to help free private jessica lynch
NEVENT : lara hijacking in 1995 has been captured by u.s. forces in or near baghdad
NEVENT : now look as if this man abu absaas in u.s. hands
NEVENT : miles
NEVENT : good evening
NEVENT : they threw his body overboard
NEVENT : national security correspondent david ensor joins us live from washington
NEVENT : david
NEVENT : peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year
NEVENT : paul vercammen joins me now from martinez, california, with the latest for us
NEVENT : paul
NEVENT : well, lou, one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one, an adult female, and two, the remains of the almost full-term baby boy
NEVENT : and of course, this is significant because laci peterson, when she disappeared from her modesto home, was 7 1/2 months pregnant
NEVENT : that was on christmas eve
NEVENT : her husband, scott, at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina
NEVENT : now, in a strange twist in all of this, just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone, and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case
NEVENT : this person came across the bone at the shore
NEVENT : he brought it home and contacted the authorities, and we took possession of it
NEVENT : and you're trying to connect it to the other
NEVENT : well, we're trying to find out if it's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others
NEVENT : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact
NEVENT : now this case is also taking on a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body
NEVENT : this is in the damage aspect of it
NEVENT : we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes
NEVENT : reporting live from martinez, california, i'm paul vercammen, now back to you
NEVENT : paul, let me ask you, if i may, quickly, are we expecting is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon
NEVENT : it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records
NEVENT : that's particularly important for the adult female remains
NEVENT : so now they're going to have to turn to dna, and that's why they're calling in these experts
NEVENT : some dna testing can be very quick, but sometimes it can take up to weeks, even more, lou
NEVENT : okay
NEVENT : paul vercammen, thank you very much
NEVENT : as paul just reported, the modesto, california police department will be holding a news conference just a few minutes from now, and cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live
NEVENT : stay with us
NEVENT : the story of one boy who's lucky enough to be alive
NEVENT : i'm mary snow with this check of head lines
NEVENT : american airlines' fate is hanging on its flight attend attendant's union
NEVENT : it's narrowly rejected union today
NEVENT : number of companies are planning to cut their payrolls
NEVENT : motorola saying it will eliminate another 3,000 jobs, 3% of its work force
NEVENT : let's look at the latest numbers on the dow

NEVENT : the dow industrials down 64 points

NEVENT : he was captured in baghdad late monday night
NEVENT : disabled american tourist kling klinghoffer was on board
NEVENT : more coverage continues now
NEVENT : as we reported, one key initiative is the search for weapons of mass destruction
NEVENT : mike boettcher has our exclusive report
NEVENT : dr. rehab taha, aka dr. germ, who directed iraq's biological weapons program
NEVENT : cnn has exclusively obtained the united nations english translations of her arabic work papers
NEVENT : her research was conducted here at a location well-known to u.n. arms inspectors
NEVENT : 300 miles west of baghdad
NEVENT : her notes begin with the test objective
NEVENT : her written words are read by a narateor
NEVENT : a field experiment was conducted to disperse biological agents, botulinum toxin and spors of bacillus
NEVENT : the tests were a success
NEVENT : taha then described the success of their tests using an anthrax sim lant and artillery rockets
NEVENT : dr. taha's notes do not tell us how far she eventually progressed in her biological weapons testing
NEVENT : that's why the marines came knocking
NEVENT : looking for her papers and looking for her
NEVENT : mike boettcher, cnn, baghdad
NEVENT : and she has not been
NEVENT : prosecutors say longo stood his family because they stood before him and the life he craved
NEVENT : now cnn's coverage of the new iraq continues
NEVENT : the operation as it continues in the north continues to be a situation of unrest
NEVENT : the area around mosul described as uncertain in terms of its stability with deliberate agitation
NEVENT : those are the words there that general brooks used a short time ago
NEVENT : also, news about another half-broth of saddam hussein apparently now apprehended overnight in baghdad with the i assistance of local iraqis
NEVENT : not sure where in baghdad, personal the person western neighborhood of mansour
NEVENT : we'll go through all of this throughout the morning here
NEVENT : first, to the pentagon and barbara starr to pick up what's happening
NEVENT : power being restored on a rolling basis throughout baghdad today
NEVENT : the city went dark two weeks ago leaving people without electricity or the ability to cook or keep food from spoiling
NEVENT : engineers have managed to restart two substations and six diesel plants and also need that to help the hospitals get online as well
NEVENT : general brooks talking about three major points
NEVENT : top leaders in iraq
NEVENT : no remains identified just yet, general brooks says, but only the initial surveys have been completed so far
NEVENT : again, all this is an outstanding issue right now
NEVENT : in the north, you're going to hear a lot about the shallow graves today
NEVENT : at least 1500, maybe 1600 graves located in the north
NEVENT : jane arraf has made her way to that location and we heard her first live report about an hour ago and we will talk with jane again
NEVENT : we know that, quote, work will be done with the iraqis and that work will come, we are told, in the coming days
NEVENT : a wrap from centcom and here is fredricka whitfield at the cnn center
NEVENT : check in on the pentagon for more and more on this tape and what they're saying down in washington
NEVENT : 6:33 a.m., cnn's jane arraf report from kirkuk that local authorities and u.s. investigators are still mystified by a graveyard on a military base abandoned by the old iraqi regime

NEVENT : 8:10 a.m., abu dhabi tv broadcasts videotape which it says shows saddam hussein in a baghdad neighborhood last wednesday, april 9th, the day the city fell to coalition troops
NEVENT : the network has not said where it got the tape
NEVENT : there's no way to confirm when it was shot or whether the man in the video is really saddam hussein
NEVENT : iraqi museum workers are starting to assess the damage to iraq's history
NEVENT : up to 20 loot the artifacts have been returned after religious clerics called for the action
NEVENT : now officials in the worldwide museum community have pledged their help in restoring iraq's past
NEVENT : liz george explains
NEVENT : iraq's history, iraq's culture
NEVENT : it's all demolished
NEVENT : a cry from the heart from one of iraq's archaeologists
NEVENT : a cry echoing around the world
NEVENT : it's a catastrophe
NEVENT : it's a catastrophe for the people of iraq, it's a catastrophe for the whole world, because the civilization of ancient iraq was the first urban civilization in the world
NEVENT : the british museum is home to the largest mesopotamia collection outside iraq, including some of the earliest forms of writing
NEVENT : it's the duty of international community to restore as much as possible to the museum and then, i think, the international community must organize itself to help the iraqi colleagues restore what is left
NEVENT : the british museum is putting six conserve tors and three curators into this as soon as it's possible
NEVENT : they'll go to work with the iraqi colleagues as
NEVENT : breaking news out of long beach, a situation with a standoff involving a 2-year-old and a man with a gun, this one having a peaceful ending

NEVENT : and i thank you for that help
NEVENT : today, i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by the united states against iraq's old government
NEVENT : first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i'm suspending the iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of certain commitment necessary for iraq's reconstruction
NEVENT : secondly,'m directing the secretary to relax sanctions on american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that contributed to humanitarian reconstruction
NEVENT : soon, at the u.n
NEVENT : security council, the united states, great britain and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the united nations

NEVENT : i wasn't taking risks
NEVENT : he was right about that
NEVENT : should have taken the side of the rebels then
NEVENT : helping the kurds, removing the regime
NEVENT : absolutely
NEVENT : we'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we'd done that
NEVENT : that seems to be the core of the argument
NEVENT : as you point out, of course, for the fact of the matter is, the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately
NEVENT : the mistakes of the united states, again, as you point out, norman schwarzkopf making a peace, permitting helicopters to fly
NEVENT : still hurts me to read this
NEVENT : they say, okay, we have lost this round
NEVENT : do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things
NEVENT : and he says, yeah, that's all right
NEVENT : they ask again, are you sure they mean that

NEVENT : mr. cheney's the only one i know that changed his mind
NEVENT : most of those that took the view at that time, think until recently they were correct in saving saddam hussein

NEVENT : many others
NEVENT : namely, the republican guard absolutely devastated
NEVENT : yes
NEVENT : and, well, we know now the harvest of all that

NEVENT : mistakes made then, mistakes part of human experience, but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes
NEVENT : is it your sense that the united states is on the right track

NEVENT : katrina leung is no matt aharry, as people have suggested

NEVENT : leung, a prominent chinese-american, was practically the toast of l.a
NEVENT : she was seemingly present for just about every event involving local politicians, sometimes national ones, and various high-ranking officials of the chinese government

NEVENT : kelli arena reports
NEVENT : the fbi's interest in this state park in maryland dates back to last december
NEVENT : officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the park's ponds
NEVENT : officials say they found the tip significant because the pond is about ten miles from fort dietrick where the army experimented with anthrax
NEVENT : agents searched the area at least four times since then
NEVENT : the mayor says the fbi is now considering draining one of the ponds
NEVENT : the police chief dine is in regular contact with the fbi
NEVENT : there are a number of facets to this investigation
NEVENT : it's very, very significant
NEVENT : according to government sources, agents in december found a large plastic enclosed container with large openings on the side
NEVENT : the fbi has said nothing publicly about anyone it may be investigating, but attorney general john ashcroft did refer publicly to steven hatfield, a former researcher as a person of interest
NEVENT : he's repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and the spokesman told cnn
NEVENT : investigators involved this case clearly frustrated
NEVENT : kelly, where does this investigation on hatfield stand
NEVENT : i mean, we have rather i can't think of another case like it
NEVENT : we've got rather public statements by law enforcement officials saying that he is the suspect that they think he's the guy athen we have denial and then we have this stuff
NEVENT : it's really really extraordinary
NEVENT : well, the attorney general has been the only person that has even mentioned steven hatfield's name publicly and he called him a person of interest

NEVENT : president khatami is in beirut and what is observed here is very closely watched, what kind of words he'll utter when he speaks to this crowd
NEVENT : iran now being pressured by the u.s. to back off on supporting hezbollah
NEVENT : the key is going to fwo see whether or not khatami actually does signal that he is going to be heeding the word of president bush and backing off in some way in supporting hezbollah
NEVENT : that will be a very important development as we continue to watch the mideast peace process between palestinians and israelis develop

NEVENT : although he finds the reports of kennedy's womanizing credible, he believes new information about kennedy's health problems is more significant
NEVENT : jfk's public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life
NEVENT : while researching his new book on jfk, dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public
NEVENT : there are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict
NEVENT : in 1941, he flunked two military medical exams
NEVENT : his powerful father intervened, getting yet another exam
NEVENT : reading the report of his exam, one would think he never had a serious physical problem in his life
NEVENT : it was a complete whitewash that would never have been possible without his father's help
NEVENT : kennedy told a friend before he entered politics, you've got to live every day like it's your last day on earth
NEVENT : that's what i'm doing
NEVENT : jonathan karl, cnn, washington

NEVENT : well, being the justice of the peace we are the ones that hold the inquest on the death and they were required to call us to the scene
NEVENT : what did you see when you got there
NEVENT : well, to be honest with you, i saw a pretty gruesome sight and i think it's been talked about quite a bit the last few days and if anybody didn't have to be there to see it, they were lucky not to have to be there
NEVENT : it was a horrific sight, you don't have to go into details, obviously, we can only imagine how bad it might have been
NEVENT : it probably was, indeed, based on your eyewitness accounts
NEVENT : what happened

NEVENT : i know where you've been because i too have been there myself
NEVENT : that's right, i too slept with jfk
NEVENT : i am the anderson
NEVENT : technically correct but why quibble over details
NEVENT : isn't it possible deep down, that you also slept with jfk
NEVENT : who, me
NEVENT : no, i couldn't have, you protest
